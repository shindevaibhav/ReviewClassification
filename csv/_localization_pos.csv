Comments
"On the first and third questions they had a pretty solid idea, but question two they failed to put really any effort or real thought into. The first idea could be fleshed out better in terms of how the physical presentation would look like as well as why their idea is important and what the goal of it is.
 
 
 
 1. A very simple midi keyboard program for a computer.
 
 2. Another ipod? 
 
 3. A program that reads color and turns it into music."
"The first and third ideas seem most plausible. Combining the two, we could make certain noises when different targets are hit. Expanding on just the third idea, we could make a few different environments for the target simulator. Maybe something as simple as the silhouette targets police use in a shooting range, or as complex as a city street/alley/etc."
"I would say that ideas 2 and 3 are definitely more focused with and objective, however though I am impressed with idea 1, it explains more of what your skills are rather than an actual particular project such as ""make a video that does X"" or ""compose a song around X ideas"". I got confused at the beginning of 1 because you state that you could build a website but then later make note that you do not have much programming experience, so I am assuming this would be done by some other means like a template website designer and not actually using HTML and CSS."
"You have a great goal, to make cycling safer. If only you wrote down a few more ways to achieve this. A way to report dangers threw an app or something is a great idea. It would give cyclist a voice and push the city to make changes. What other ways can this be done?"
"Ideas 1 and 3 do not have a definitive project idea and are more so how far along one could develop the stages of making an idea in that time, whereas 2 the idea is to find a way to make education free to individuals. In idea one the student states that they could outline and blueprint some rough ideas of what a final project may do, and plan the next stages to get there. In idea 3 the student states that they would recruit a team of individuals to develop a more cohesive project."
"This student did a great job at stretching their thinking. There are three ideas present, each with their own unique twist on them due to the limitations of either time or money. The first idea is a game, not sure what platform, that calculates reaction time of the user. It would be awesome to have further discussion on what this could be used for; personally, I see this mini-game being used for competition entertainment between friends. The second idea is a group of games used to encourage a healthy and fit lifestyle by using a reward benefactor to motivate people. The third idea touches briefly on the student's passion to expand their gaming company."
As far as the description of the idea goes it does hit some points. I like the idea of the game for fitness. I'm a little confused about it being an video games or an physical game like sports? I like how it would incorporate on the physical aspect of fitness like using gym equipments for the workout. The incentive on accumulating points is also a great idea. I picture this idea as in the Wii Fit game but not augmented reality? An example on this would be helpful for a visual example.
"The first and third ideas - using hand-painted images for a wedding, etc. book, and educational games - have been done many times over. The second idea - changing the look of a building based on internal or external activity - seems like it could be done easily enough, and I don't know that it's been done before."
"I think the student has interesting ideas regarding the exploratory questions of this assignment, but needs to be more specific about their ideas in question 2 and 3. How would the display make the skyscraper building ""less standard""? What are the games that can be played outside of the classroom? 
 
 
 
 His/her three ideas are to create a wedding book of painted stock images, an interactive display of digital arts at the side of a skyscraper, and an educational video games based on a business idea."
"The first idea was a scanable storybook program, that simplifies and makes creating photo albums easy and simple. The second was to create a building that would react to people in, around, and people looking at the building, interacting visually with all of them. The third idea is video game education program, working inside schools and possibly outside. 
 
 
 
 The ideas were sincere but the last idea really could have been explained a bit more, all ideas are good. Especially the building idea, it really makes me wish that existed in a large scale."
"There are three good ideas present, however not all answers have deeply thought out ideas. I love the ideas but I wish the student would have expanded on their ideas. The first idea is to create a first person shooter game. I like the idea of creating a map/level that can be added to a first person shooter game. It would be awesome to have a game that allowed the game community and its aspiring developers be the creation factor of the maps, levels, and content. The second idea is to build a gaming team to create video games that raise discussion on important topics/issues in the world. These games will also keep the traditional aspect of what a game is. The third idea would be to create an exploration game."
"Idea one is to design a game, non-functional, but with the architecture in place. Idea two is to essentially make their own video game development company and eventually build the best game possible. Lastly, idea 3 is to make a small exploration driven game, examples are stated but I have no experience with any of them to know what they may be."
i could help with what goes on in the game. The story line or goal in the game.
"I think that you have a few good ideas about what you want to do, however I am a little unclear on both of them. 
 
 
 
 1) For the pistol device that you mentioned in idea 2: Why is it a designed to be pistol like? If you are worried about negligent or improper behavior in a community, why would you shape your device to look like a deadly weapon? Additionally, could you elaborate a little more on what you meant by patrol device? What makes it more or less specialized than a smart phone?
 
 
 
 2) For the mobile app: I too find it interesting to manipulate a mobile device to track social and personal habits. What kind of error proofing will you need to do in order to make sure the mobile app doesn't go off during every quiet situation? Also what kind of habits are you specifically attempting to track? The range of personal and social habits is a pretty broad range."
"The answer in the first idea is pretty vague. The writer seems more interested in putting down steps for developing an idea rather than actually conceptualizing a project. The second question is more thoroughly thought out and visualized, though there are some privacy and safety questions arising from the idea of a private autonomous, or at least mobile, surveillance system. The third idea is the most feasible, though I would fins it kind of irritating if my phone kept making personal comments about my habits and randomly playing music suddenly when it gets quiet."
They seemed to make a sincere effort and propose three things. The first being to just simply plan ahead as much as possible. The second was to create a non profit company organization that hires law enforcement that uses patrol devices. The third is to showcase a demo of the idea with a mobile app.
"I think this student really thought through what they could do with the time and resources with a project, and came up with some really interesting ideas."
"I'm not sure if the first one is something I would work on with this student, just because I like to create things that are used and help people. Although it's a cool idea, I'm not sure that music or sounds playing when you open the door or touch the handle are something that I would find interesting enough to help on. 
 
 
 
 However, I would definitely be able to help with the other two ideas. I think the mapping is a great idea, especially in a very cultural way. You would be able to discover things with the mapping that you wouldn't normally be able to unless you took a trip all the way there which takes time and money. 
 
 
 
 I would also be able to work on the last one, also possibly working on a fun animation PSA to spread across the country and the world and hopefully be able to get more individuals involved in saving the Earth's resources."
"Only two ideas were provided, but I did feel the classmate gave adequate descriptions of their ideas. 
 
 
 
 1.A project that involves touch and sound. When individuals touched a door handle, this action would trigger different sounds. 
 
 2.Large scale projection mapping. The project might involve projecting related historical videos on large historical monuments. The point of this project would be to give tourist the opportunity to learn about history when visiting historical sites.
 
 3.Classmate would like to work on a project that helps people."
The projection mapping project is of the most interest to me. I believe this project would be best accomplished by developing a large scale projector. I like the idea of helping to teach the general public about history in a new and exciting way.
"There is definitely some vague writing on the third idea - saying ""I don't know,"" but maybe doing some game - but the other two ideas - interactive touch sensors to trigger sound, and projection mapping onto landmarks - are less vague, but not all that original. There are plenty of videos on YouTube with people projection mapping onto various buildings, and plenty of things (including childrens' toys) use touch sensors to make noises."
"Were I to work with this student, I would prefer to do something with the projection mapping. Obviously in the classroom/showcase setting we wouldn't be able to project onto anything like the great wall, but we could use the same idea on a smaller scale."
"These seem like a person's scribbled notes, and took me a little bit to decipher. They didn't think the ideas all the way trough to the presentation, just the general idea of it. To me its hard to visualize something if they don't describe the physical parts or generally explain how they would get it done and why it differs from the average idea.
 
 1. A computer program thermometer
 
 2. 3D printing research
 
 3. Virtual joust?"
"If I was to work with this student, then I would suggest that we extend on the idea of making a arduino program that can sense the temperature and gives some sort of results."
"This person gives a pretty clear idea of what he wants to create, but fails to explain the purpose of creating it. What would set it apart? Why make something like this? Sometimes people don't know about a certain movie so how would you then explain your idea to them?
 
 
 
 1. colored light programmed by arduino
 
 2. Virtual Reality gaming
 
 3. Motion Capture rc car"
"I would have this student's knowledge of Arduino assist me in getting together a system that plays a colored light when a person presses a button, but then also takes a picture of that person at that same time; thus creating a ""selfie"" filter that is created instantly like a photobooth. Another use for it is we could do long exposure photos, and the user could press certain lights to light the picture before drawing with their LED."
"I think the student made an effort with their ideas, although they could use more information as to what tools they would want to try and use. For example, in his third idea, it is unclear as to what softwares or hardware would be needed in order to control the car or plane.
 
 
 
 Reiteration of ideas:
 
 Idea 1 - Using arduino, make an interactive system with 3 buttons that change colors.
 
 Idea 2 - Submerge a user into a virtual reality world.
 
 Idea 3 - Control RC car or plane with hand movements."
"If me and this student were assigned to work on a project I think that both of us would have to come to a compromise since I am not skilled in the area that the student is speaking of doing a project on. I believe that the second idea that the student spoke on is a project that we could actually work on together, and we could also combine aspects of the first and third idea together to make a really cool project."
"It seems that this student detailed how their proposed project for the semester would look in a week, a semester, and in an unspecific amount of time with a billion dollars, rather than proposing three different ideas. The idea seems to be to make hardware, like a robot, that mimics the way the human body looks and works, with the end goal of using it to study the form of the body. The purpose of studying the form is not clear, though with the types of things this student wishes to do, it appears to be useful for general knowledge of the body for anyone that may want to know, whether artistic or health-related."
"This seems rather hardware-focused for the semester, while my skills focus on software. I'd be able to make it into more of an active, functional robot, perhaps as a way to simulate how the human body would move and react to various factors."
"This student definitely put a lot of thought into all of their project ideas. For the first idea, she goes into what she would do for the first week, such as planning, budgeting, getting the proper equipment, and meeting with professionals in the field she wishes her project to be in. As for the project itself, I'm not entirely sure what she is aiming to do. She wishes to use neural feedback, as well as feedback from a sensor that gets data from heartbeat. 
 
 
 
 For the second idea, it sounds like she would use the billion dollars to get a bunch of experts (in their respective fields) to help create a sort of therapy for special needs children. She would also have a bunch of equipment to show a progression of their healing/recovery. To me, it sounds like idea 2 is a further expansion of idea 1, which totally clears some stuff up for me.
 
 
 
 For the third idea, it's what has been going on for the previous two. Using data from the brain and the heart to get some sort of outcome. She was unsure of what is realistic for the time given this semester. She didn't propose three different items, but rather one idea that has different outcomes based on her time and money."
So the first answer didn't really say anything that this student could accomplish. It was all very vague and I couldn't figure out what the mobilemousecase project was.
If I knew what this student wanted to work on I would be able to gage what we could do together but I'm not sure what their interests are.
No they did not stretch our thinking. 1. No idea 2. go to Dubai 3. A mobile mouse case.
"I dont really know what the mobile mouse case is but going to Dubai sounds like fun, I had a blast last time I was there."
I don't know what mobile mouse case is. It sees like you can use your mobile as a mouse. Very interesting. Hope you can do it!
"It sounds as if you have one solid idea. Could you elaborate a little more on it? You call it your mobile mouse case, so what exactly makes it specialized?"
"I'm pretty sure I couldn't contribute very much. By the sound of it, this student has a pretty good grasp on what they plan on doing. However if they were accepting help I might be able to help craft the project. I spent a year in industrial design crafting prototypes and I might be able to lend a hand in the actual making of this product."
"Some of the ideas were successful, and some weren't. I think their idea 2 was the strongest."
"I really liked the idea 2. We would definitely have to modify it, but I think that within our own phoenix community there are a lot of dichotomies physical appearances."
"The person didn't put too much thought into this one.
 
 The first idea is to create a small digital physical system or installation that looks cool.
 
 The second idea is to connect everyone by creating a internet infrastructure that uses solar/kinetic powered equipment.
 
 The third idea is to simply create a interactive mobile phone app."
I don't really feel like this student stretched the thinking on this assignment. The effort was barely made for this assignment.
I don't know what this student wanted to do so I'm not sure how we could collaborate. A game or installation is very vague.
"Their ideas are far too vague, I can't really start to picture what they had in their mind from this limited explanation. I am not too sure they too this assignment with the utmost sincerity. That being said, the general idea of what they wish to accomplish is quite clear due to its concentration of words. However, many questions about their ideas exist. Why do we need a new internet infrastructure? What type of game/app do you want to develop? What type of installation do you wish to build, and with what tools?
 
 
 
 Their ideas: 
 
 
 
 One Week: A small digital installation that has physical elements to it.
 
 
 
 Unlimited Time and Money: To create a new infrastructure for the internet that allows for everyone to be connected using solar/kinetic power as its power source.
 
 
 
 Realistic Semester: To create an interactive mobile game."
"I think the student put in effort but the ideas are still very vague for idea 2 and 3.
 
 
 
 Idea 1 - The idea mentioned painting the body of his motorcycle.
 
 
 
 Idea 2 - The idea mentioned creating a project that would make people more physically active. How would you go about promoting that? What motive would people have to jog instead of drive somewhere (especially when your destination is very far away)?
 
 
 
 Idea 3 - The idea mentioned creating a social media app for motorcycle riders. Need more information on what this app does, what software/programming language you are using, etc."
"Combining these ideas is somewhat tricky, since they seem to conflict with one another. On one side, you are trying to persuade people to be more physically active, but on the other side, there seems to be a big interest in motorcycling. If I had to extend on one of your ideas though, I'd maybe incorporate features to your social media app that not only talk about motorcycles, but also inform the public about being more physically active."
"I mentioned designing an Arcology when referencing your second idea (making people more active). Maybe we could work that into your project this semester. Obviously you could not make such a structure in a semester, however maybe you could draw up some blueprints for it. You could design it so that people would not have to use cars to get anywhere with everywhere being accessible by walking or elevators. You could look up how to make a self sufficient Arcology and try to incorporate that into your blueprints, was well as where you would place emergency services, housing, commercial, and schools."
"I think that you have some good ideas. I really liked the first idea that you came up with it sounds as if you have put some thought into it. As for your second idea, would it be possible to empower these communities with a simplified version of your plan. When I think of the struggles that these communities have to deal with, my first notion is not that they are in need of jobs. Couldn't you help provide these communities with the means of acquiring power without setting up a full on power plant? Is there a cheaper, more dispensable means of creating a power generating device for these communities? Much like the paper water filter book, could you develop something that could provide usable energy at a low cost?"
"The three ideas were creating a short film that can inspire and also intrigue an audience, help make the world a better/happier place without the use a pharmaceutical drugs, and to learn more of the side of engineering and development. Some of the answers were pretty vague, like what type of film do you think would be inspirational, what type of audience or culture would you like to base it off of or target the film to? What do YOU think can make the world happier? Just try to expand more on these ideas and it would help."
Didnt go much in depth on any of the ideas. Pretty vague.
Not sure since I cant seem to figure out what the projects are exactly.
"The student actually made a sincere effort and I believe gave very honest answers, except for the third answer, the student didn't really answer the question or give an idea. The student actually clearly proposes two things, the first idea was about making an inspirational film, the second idea was about researching what makes a human happy without drugs, and to make a device that trains the human brain to think in a positive and non negative way."
"Your film idea is kind of vague. Inspirational can be so many things to so many people, you might want to focus on a specific topic over everything else. For your second idea, a ton of research would need to be made. You said you'd like to make the world happy with out the use of pharmaceutical drugs which makes me think you're also trying to have something that will help fight depression, not just boredom or sadness. A thing to keep in mind is that the brain holds onto more negative thoughts than positive. The third idea almost sounds like you'd like to know more about developing a program? I'm not really sure what you'd want to accomplish, but you should look for a group that is well rounded, and pay attention to your developers."
"I like the idea about making people happy and I know there is someone else who would like to do something similar to that in this class. What I think I would do first with this idea is to set a specific group (like college students around campus) and just go out and start interviewing. If you have a set list of questions its easy to just go up to someone and ask for some input. The good thing about starting on campus is that there are so many students from all different backgrounds, you'll start to get that wide variety of research you're looking for."
"In the first idea, they clearly propose they would make a short film that was inspirational and intriguing to an audience. The only thing about this is, different people feel different emotions. What is intriguing to one person could bore the living hell out of another.
 
 
 
 The second idea is basically saying they want to make people happy! Without the use of any drugs. I fully support this idea.
 
 
 
 There isn't really a third idea, just the student saying that they want to work more with the development side of things."
"So the second idea is definitely not in reach for a semester. You could combine the first and third ideas though. Obviously a short film would have some sort of sound, but maybe you could make a short film documenting how much you learn about music?"
"It was little hard to imagine what project would be. However, I agree with a week would be short week to develop a project. Also, some project could not make with unlimited fund and short time. I think you are good visualist and if you collaborate with other designers such as sound, media installation, and animator, it would be great project during this semester. Moreover, you can make plant to connect these three ideas that visual, clean water or self driving system, and music stuff. These are would be great project to interective each system to make human life better."
The student wrote vaguely about their own motivations and didn't really provide any ideas for a project.
There aren't any proposed ideas to go off of to make into a project
"1) Vague notion of video editing
 
 2) vague notion of humanitarian efforts
 
 3) Vague notion of creating music.
 
 
 
 Basically, it's pretty vague."
Maybe something with iterative video? Take video of people wanting previous participants and do some sort of synthesis using the similarities (or differences).
"The student said they could make some sort of interactive installation, something robotic, or a matrix made of LEDs for the first idea. For the second idea, the student said that instead of one huge project, they would would work on making what we have easier to make and at cheaper costs. This way, more people could make things to solve more problems. For the third idea, I kind of don't understand it, but that's totally on me because it seems like they know what they are talking about. I'm just not sure the final outcome."
"To be honest, pretty sure I'm not on this person's level, neither thinking, or actual like tinkering. Obviously you could blend the first and the third projects because you mention an installation, lights, and robotics. I'm not sure how interactive the third idea is, but maybe instead of a camera looking at the hanging LEDs from below, it can look at it from above and have people walk under the lights? This way like if someone is walking and the lights are hanging too low, you can move them up with the pulley system you were mentioning. And use a Kinect to measure distance."
"The person has a broad range of interests, but I feel that the first two responses are really vague since they talk about what kind of projects they want to work on rather than what projects. Also, what they specified in the first question may be something that would be more than they can handle in one week.
 
 
 
 The third idea is much clearer as they explain their project and its structure and functions. 
 
 
 
 Their three ideas are some project that deals with electrical devices, a cheap hardware to help people, and a mechanical display that moves in fluid-like motion."
"The third idea has a lot to work with, so I would like to extend that into a large art piece that can be placed at a water show or a museum of machines. I think it would be interesting to see the inner working, like cables and light connections, to give the display some flair too."
"I know nothing about music and theater, but maybe with my sculpture skills we could design a set. Although the set would be here in Tempe, it could reference South Korean theater and draw attention to the South Korean theater community both here and abroad."
"I found this classmates ideas interesting, but had difficulty understanding the details, and how their ideas would be accomplished. 
 
 
 
 1. In a week, this classmate would brainstorm and ask key questions about their project. They are most interested in working on a project that connects sound and visuals. 
 
 2. This classmate would like to create an infinite theatre, with an interactive component. The theatre would involve state of the art equipment and take up an unlimited amount of space. 
 
 3. In a semester, this classmate would create an interactive performance scene."
"If I were to work with this classmate I would be most interested in working with him to create an infinite theatre. This idea sounded interesting, but I couldnt quite understand the details or picture the end result. I think this project would involve a great deal of technological and artistic components, but I would need to have a better understanding of the project to know what was needed to physically accomplish it."
"The person has given thought to it, but doesnt describe the ideas quite enough.
 
 The first idea is to create a graphic novel.
 
 The second idea is to create a cartoon from the characters he/she has already created.
 
 The third idea is is to ultimately create a graphic novel."
"All of the ideas have to do with either graphic novels or cartoons, so why not create a connection. Make a book that has the cartoon within it. Create a book, then put a screen within it, and instead of having a regular graphic novel, the cartoon appears."
"1) Graphic novel
 
 2) full cartoon
 
 3) Webcomic leading into graphic novel.
 
 
 
 I would have liked more detail on each idea. None of these are fleshed out enough for my liking."
I just have NO idea of what this person is saying.
I would collaborate with this student to create real stimulating sound for the virtual world idea. One of the most important parts of our experience and reality is the 5 senses. I would want to make sure the sound design is perfectly matched to how it is in reality.
"All of your ideas seem to be based around developing some sort of game or program. It isn't that I don't find these ideas interesting, however what other projects might you be open to? For example, with your second idea: Would you take it a step further and utilize the Oculus Rift headset?"
"I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to offer you much assistance with your project. Although I have some experience developing games and programming, I have a very limited knowledge on the subject. However if you needed somebody to help craft something or to help develop character designs, I could be the man for the job."
"This student made a very sincere effort and gave some very interesting answers, the student clearly proposed three ideas. The first idea is about showcasing project mapping by using max msp. The second idea is an interactive gaming system for children in hospitals that involves a digital environment. The last idea was creating a new way of playing video games that eliminates ""screen watching""."
"It is very apparent that this person to the time and effort to sincerely answer all three idea questions. They go into detail on what they exactly want to accomplish as well as what tools they would like to use for their project. I could very easily get a picture in my head for each of their three concepts and thus believe they explained their points clearly and concisely.
 
 
 
 Their ideas: 
 
 
 
 One Week: They wish to using projection mapping for either an art gallery or to show off their own line of clothing. They would use Max msp to facilitate the projection mapping and would plan on using video.
 
 
 
 Unlimited Time and Money: The wish to create a digital environment projection mapped into a room that children in hospitals and explore and play with using their hands or feet instead of controllers.
 
 
 
 Realistic Semester: A cube that would not allow the transgression of video game screen looking to cheat when planing with friends. This cube will have each player's perspective projection mapped on a different face making nigh impossible to catch a glimpse of what your friend in doing."
"I think your anti screen looking project idea is amazing, too often I have caught my younger brother committing this cardinal video game sin. The cube was a great idea, ignoring the top and bottom of the cube you have 4 surfaces and with video games often offering 4 player co-op you can projection map on each of the sides. you can make the cube sort of a furniture piece, coming with chairs (maybe cubes as well), and a way to easily store it+its projectors. I can not help you on the lines of knowing Max, but I think you should think ahead a bit to on how you could market such an awesome device/piece of furniture. The cube look could work as a ""futuristic"" vibe and that alone could be enough to get people interested. You could also make it so that it could be installed in arcades or bars allowing people to play games with friends or strangers."
"My way-far-out-you-are-insane addition: let's make a completely projected room from the outside-in, possibly using something like four white cloth sheets and project a 3D space from outside and possibly add some sort of motion tracking mechanism with objects or the people.
 
 
 
 My bound-to-earth proposal: yeah, let's do that."
"You have a good grasp on what you'd like to do. As long as you're comfortable with projection mapping I believe that all of your ideas will work. I'm not exactly sure what you would do with the art gallery, but if you've made some pieces of you're own you could make them pop using the projection. I also like that you're thinking of working with kids. You can do a lot with the idea of making an interactive environment around them, and even make it so that they can visit different places around the world from their own bed. The only thing I'm concerned about with the xbox is the split screen projection mapping. You might have to work with 2 different projectors."
I'd want to work more with your clothing brand idea. If you have some physical objects that people could model you could take video of that and then build a runway like stage to make an infinite runway. Along it you could use projection mapping on some mannequins along the way so that people can look at what you have.
"This is the most well thought out and fully realized pitches for an idea I've read so far. The carving of a wolf sounds like a lot of fun, but also a lot of work. The space installation sounds fascinating, especially the concepts being conveyed by the piece."
The idea about creating the frame sounds very unique. I would like to see something like that.
"I'm not really sure how I could tie these together honestly. The ideas are very different, but maybe I'm just not thinking outside the box enough. However, I am thinking that maybe you could just smash all the ideas together, creating the installation with the sculpture instead of the light and it allows people to feel what others are feeling. I'm not really sure though."
"The interactive system featuring the mermaid and the inverse of Twitch Plays Pokemon seem like two appealing ideas that can be blended. I am thinking that the project could be an installation of tv and projector such that a video game console is hooked up to a tv, which has a projection mapping of a mermaid on the screen. Whatever button a user presses on their console, the button can affect the mermaid's behaviors."
"All three responses are good ideas, even if idea #2 is currently technologically infeasible. 
 
 
 
 1. A setup that allows a player to play 5 simple games at once as an interesting experience. 
 
 
 
 2. A device that allows users to jump between timelines/ dimensions to try out different actions or choices in life. 
 
 
 
 3. A tank with a projection mapped mermaid inside that reacted to people in a room."
"The ideas are definitely clear as they are and feel well thought-out. The first idea is a stand to hold various electronic devices and chargers on a stand, specifically next to a bed. The second idea is a low-cost wearable device that generates energy through being outdoors or exercising, potentially solving both energy and health problems through motivating people to exercise to charge their electronic devices. The third idea is a game in which the student does most of the artistic work (art, models, environments, etc), and although the exact design of the game is not clear, it appears the student would prefer to work on a shooter of some sort."
"You'd like to make a stand to reduce the clutter of electronics. The problem with it is that there is stuff already kind of like that, and organizers already made. If you do make it so that its all contained with in the nightstand it could be really neat and even marketable. 
 
 
 
 For your second idea I think solar energy would be your best bet because I'm not sure of how you could take energy from the body and transfer it into a battery. With this idea, any article of clothing could be used for quick energy which would be pretty neat. The big problem I see is the lack of comfort from the clothing that you might get with attaching batteries and other things. People probably won't want to wear it if it's uncomfortable, especially if its hot. 
 
 
 
 The third Idea seems to be thought out, but I'm not sure what your concept is for the game. If you're good with animation you might be able to make a trailer that would spark interest for programmers. I think the biggest part before moving onto working with the occulus rift is to find that group to make your trailer and create a small part of the game."
"I like the idea of a hat or shirt that gathers electricity and i would want to branch off more on that, more because I'm not really sure about you're game idea, but I'd also like to learn more about it. As for the clothing, I think a big thing is focusing on the overall design of the clothing, to make sure that people would wear them. I also think development of a solar battery would need to go into the shits/hats/pants as well. Things to consider is if they need to be connected to the shirt at all times, how heavy they would be, and if the article are machine washable."
"The student could use more time to get more specific with the ideas.
 
 The first just states what they would work with not exactly what they would make.
 
 The second is for a system that automatically tended to a garden, I was wondering how this would be done.
 
 The last is for an interactive sculpture which seems interesting."
"I would try to help this student get more specific on there goals.
 
 What is the end result?
 
 How would you want people to feel?
 
 What would the sculpture be or do?"
"I really like the arduino planting idea. I'm not really sure what I add at this point, but the idea is interesting and could really find a use in different businesses around the world."
"The student put in a lot of time and effort into his/her ideas. Although these ideas are very detailed with what the student wants accomplished in the end, ideas 2 and 3 need more information as to what exactly Digital Culture students would be doing during the semester/year to apply their skills, aka, the ""engage and make it fun"" and ""find a way to expand"" needs work. I do understand the overall goal but this needs more explanation as to what a group of 4 students would be doing exactly.
 
 
 
 Reiteration of ideas:
 
 Idea 1 - Complete composition of two songs for cinematic, game, or advertisement.
 
 Idea 2 - Create campus ministries in all of the universities in America to establish relationships with the campus and business in the respective state.
 
 Idea 3 - Build partnerships with organizations and expand The Respect Movement to other campuses."
"Since your first idea seems to show an interest in creating music, I think you could tie this in with ideas 2 and 3. As an example, use the semester to create a song, maybe even a music video, to promote ideas 2 and 3. This music video could use projectors, cameras, and software that the digital culture has available to students."
"The person has definitely thought of what they wanted to do. Although, I'm honestly not sure how exactly it would tie into digital culture. I do see potential in it though. Maybe some more thought about what digital culture is about, then try and make something that ties directly to that idea.
 
 The first idea is to basically make a song for someone.
 
 The second idea is to create an organization kinda like the Newman Center but better.
 
 The third idea is to become more connected with other campuses to create a more equal culture."
"I think that maybe we could tie in the songs with individuals and their need for equality. I guess what I am saying is that we could make an installation that scans someones face, then according to their structure or facial expression, it would create a song for that person."
"I am intrigued by the project on the third bullet, only thing that keeps me wondering how well it would work is just the movement part because part of the illusion of space involvements like this is kinesthesic activity.
 
 
 
 SO!
 
 
 
 Introducing Virtuix Omni: a treadmill specifically designed of VR movement. http://www.virtuix.com/
 
 
 
 Perhaps using this could help with the production, albeit I am not sure if it would work way much better using Oculus Rift as well, which might just ruin the point of creating a projected environment outside.
 
 
 
 But I digress, I can sense something brewing."
"The ideas of a physical object that can be projected on with animations that can cater to the shape, a cloth or outfit that can be tracked and projected onto for plays and musicals, and a Immersive animation sequence that give the persona sense of being in the POV of the character. You did give this sincere effort and I do like the three of your ideas. I actually love the idea of the clothing that can be tracked and projected onto. It sounds extremely difficult but since your given a billion dollars I'm sure you can accomplish it."
"I would like to go with the immersive environment animation because it coordinates well with my idea of make an immersive environment for sick children in a Child's Hospital. I feel if we made an animation sequence that can give the children a sense of POV of the character on their journey, that could greatly be helpful for them. Since most of the children do not have access to such adventures, we could make an immersive environment that can give them a sense of adventure. Also incorporate the clothing onto the child so say the child is a knight on a quest, the immersive environment would be projected onto the surrounded and a knight's outfit or armor can be projected onto the clothing of the child to really give them the POV of the character."
I would help this artist to consider the time involved in animating because they would be making two animations which is going to eat up some time especially if they want to work in 3D. I would also hope they had some ideas on what the character looked like or the environment they character would be in because I would want to get started on the animations as soon as possible.
"The student put in effort into their ideas but I think more details are needed, as well as possible tools/skills that would be required. In idea 2, I love the idea, but how would you incorporate the solar energy part with this clean water process? In idea 3, I think more information is needed as to what materials/tools/skills would possibly be required for a group of students to create possible prototypes.
 
 
 
 Reiteration of ideas:
 
 Idea 1 - Creation of the outline, draft, visual presentation, write up, and materials required for a possible project.
 
 Idea 2 - Provide clean water to people, and also an air transport system to collect rain water, purify it, and then distribute it, by using solar energy.
 
 Idea 3 - Create prototypes of idea 2 and distribute it with biodegradable containers."
I very much enjoy the idea of the rain water collecting building. We take for granted of the water supply we get in America even though some part of the country is hurting from trouts and lack of water. For an idea that gather rain water for usage is a pretty good idea. The facility can be build in an area that is rich with rain during certain time of the year like Florida or Washington. If you can collect the water then filter and a way to distribute it it would be really helpful.
"I'd love to collaborate on any of these projects, Doing concept sketches of possible characters for the magic cards, or helping to sculpt creatures for the stop-motion animation sound awesome. spending a semester working with other artists and collaborating on creating our individual portfolios and having that input from other artists sounds so beneficial."
"I like the idea of creating an interface that would create 3D prints of magic cards. Ever since I was little when I use to collect pokemon cards and yugioh cards, I always thought it would be amazing if they had something that I could scan my cards with and that would put them into a game or something. To this day they don't really have anything like that as far as for card games. I know they have Skylanders which sort of does the same thing but for action figures."
"Is Pottermore a game or does it interact with the books? In your description, it almost sounds like a game based on a book, and I am not sure that fits the criteria."
"I do not think the history of writing or the technology based readers is needed nor are the steps technology has made in computers. They make no difference to the system you are discussing. 
 
 I think if you keep your description to factual based reporting of the systems it will work better in the guide."
I wonder if Reddit has everything like you state. How is the information validated? Are there actual books there or is it just blogs and just used for information look up? Your guide is slightly confusing to me if you could clarify I would appreciate it.
"Anything Star Wars is an automatic win in my book, and I'm all for retro feels. The physical description of the book and its contents is clear, and taking the reader through the steps of how the images change is helpful to understand what makes this book special."
"I'm looking forward to seeing what kind of image you use for this post. Perhaps adding a link to the different types of posts you described (photo-centric, media, text, etc) to give the reader the chance to see how the site works would be helpful?"
"Excellent description of the features, functionality, and purpose of Pottermore website. I had heard of it before, but always considered it to be a stagnant wiki for the Potter 'verse. It was enlightening to know that Rowling continues to participate. I think your description of how this is part of the future of books was laid out well using this specific example."
"Repetition of ""lore"" in the summary. Consider using synonyms in the other places this word was used? Extra word in first sentence of section 3: ""While Pottermore is limited to <b>to</b> Harry Potter"". Awkward phrasing: ""or eventual silver screen"". Consider revising wording and encasing this section in parenthetical?"
"Excellent fact backup and mini-history of audio-blogging/podcasting. Section 3 is well thought out and highlights the pitfalls of a physical printing process, while underscoring the viability of podcasts as a literary medium. Bonus points for the use of ""bourgeois""."
"Consider adding html links to research citations and the 99% Invisible podcast. This line confused me: ""Pew Research reports that in the past 30 years the levels of individuals over the age of 18 who do not has doubled."" What are these people not doing? Consider revising wording to make this reference clear."
"I encountered several run-on sentences throughout the assignment. This made it difficult to follow the author's arguments. Consider revising and parsing arguments out into a more centralized format. Additionally, incorrect word usage (""is becoming more patience"", ""provides the reader to"", ""as oppose to a book"", etc) made it extremely difficult to assimilate the author's meaning."
"What a great example! I had no idea what to write about in my description and think that you chose the perfect media. You've provided a ton of information in your 300 word allotted space. There definitely isn't much ""fluff""- you get down to business from the start. I wish I had a better grasp of what this technology is, as I then think that this would be an extremely informative explanation. Your knowledgable of this type of media is apparent in your description and I learned something new by reading your assignment. 
 
 
 
 You seem confident in your prediction of the future of the book and readers of your assignment cannot deny the contagiousness of your excitement."
"Having no idea what an ""augmented reality reading experience"" is, your summary only confused me! Maybe somehow include in that initial summary that this product's purpose is to deliver a 3D reading and viewing experience. That is the point of this technology, correct?
 
 
 
 Also, the following sentence is confusing: ""At this time, it is an iPhone or iPad but there is an Android version under development."" I ran into many of these ""for instances"" and kept having to reread sections of your assignment. It was choppy to me and a hard read. There are numerous run on sentences and a plethora of facts but not enough explanation.Perhaps my best advice to you, as someone who has never heard of such a technology, is to reread your assignment and pretend you're in my shoes.
 
 
 
 Good luck!"
"Your summary is great - straightforward and provides the necessary information to understand your idea of the future of books. You chose a very interesting subject matter and I'm excited to check out www.postsecret.com in my free time.
 
 
 
 Your 300 word description is extremely clear and easy to follow. The time that you spent working on this assignment is apparent. You gave a great description of the book itself and allowed your readers to have a grasp of your personal experience with the book and how it changed the way you 
 
 
 
 My favorite line of your description is the following: ""The book is colorful and dark, emotional and boring, fantastic and dull.""
 
 
 
 I love the following line as well: ""What makes this book afuture book is that it doesnt have a single author. It is more like an interactive blog or news feed on an internet social media sight than an actual book."" I wouldn't have linked this book with the ever-popular social media world, but your point is great and so true.
 
 
 
 Overall, I don't think that your assignment needs much revising. You did a great job with the rough draft and looks more like a final draft to me than a rough draft!
 
 
 
 I look forward to reading and critiquing your future assignments for this course!"
"The only thing I can say could use a bit of revising would be that you kept repeating that this book is a compilation of many different people's thoughts. I felt while reading your assignment that you may have repeated this so many times in different ways to fill space and hit the required word counts. If this is true, it's unfortunate because you did a great job on this assignment. I'd omit some of these repetitive phrases in your final draft.
 
 
 
 I also noticed the misspelling of a word in the following sentence: ""What makes this book afuture book is that it doesnt have a single author. It is more like an interactive blog or news feed on an internet social media sight ([SITE]<--change to this spelling) that an actual book."""
"You gave a great summary of the work that you chose to be the future of books. Your quick snippet of a description is clear and purposeful. Your readers have a great grasp on what they are about to read in your description.
 
 
 
 I love that you included a link in your description and have every intention on visiting the website in my free time to learn more about ""Click-Clack the Rattlebag"".
 
 
 
 My favorite sentences of your assignment were the following:'Click-Clack the Rattlebag is a book in name only. Its text is entirely invisible, you see: invisible like ghosts. And thus, aesthetically,Click-Clack is a work of art presented entirely in vocal narrative."" As a reader, you definitely got me interested in the media that you chose to explore and the eerie ""Click-Clack the Rattlebag""."
"I disagree with you that the future of books will be audiobooks! That's besides the point though and a personal opinion, not a literary critique. In all, I think that you completed this assignment in a purposeful, meaningful manner.
 
 
 
 Perhaps the only critique I have is that maybe you could explain why audiobooks haven't already taken off (it's a media that's been around for quite some time) and expand on the idea of why now is the audiobook's perfect opportunity for a comeback."
"Wow! I absolutely love that you included a picture with your summary. It made your assignment come alive and was obviously the first thing that I noticed when I clicked on the title of your work. Not only did you include a picture, but it's a very interesting picture! Just by reading your summary, I got super curious as to what experiencing ""touch"" would be like on pottermore.com. I didn't know such a website existed about the Harry Potter series but am not surprised! I only read a couple of the Harry Potter books (I've never been much into fiction) but am curious and excited to explore the website. It's great that you included the link within your writing.
 
 
 
 Your excitement of this media is apparent in your writing, and definitely string along your readers to read through your whole assignment. I love how you mentioned that the pottermore.com crashed during it's initial release, that you insist that this website is just ""that cool.""
 
 
 
 I love that you realized the following: ""While it is not a replacement for the tome-like books, it brings a flair that is impossible to experience with paper alone."" (My assignment is based on this idea as well.)
 
 
 
 I think my favorite line of your assignment was the following: ""If this website could be neatly bound, pressed, and fitted with a dust jacket, it might be the most perfect book of the future."" You realize that even though the website is super cool, there is still a need for tangible bound books. I agree!"
"UNFORTUNATELY, I don't think that your assignment needs much revision. You did an excellent job of ""doing it right the first time"" and it is obvious that your sentences are thoughtful and calculated.
 
 
 
 If anything, maybe include the pottermore.com link in your summary?
 
 
 
 Great work. I'm looking forward to reading and ""critiquing"" your future assignments for this class!"
"I had a hard time finding the strengths of your assignment, as I don't think that you followed the assignment prompt. After reading and rereading your writing, I'm not clear as to what you think the future book will look like. I understand that you've done some family history research and plan on passing it down to your children and your children's children via digital photography and writing, though I have no idea about what you think the future of books will be.
 
 
 
 Please see my constructive criticism below, as I think that your rough draft needs some major rewriting."
"Your summary isn't very clear. My first suggestion would be to rewrite this portion of the assignment and be straightforward, not leaving anything to be guessed or assumed. The purpose of a summary is to tell the reader exactly what they are about to read, not to leave them wondering what your subject matter is and what they're about to get involved with.
 
 
 
 Of the five assignments I've read, yours needs the most amount of revision in my opinion. I'm not exactly sure how to approach your writing, as I kind of think the whole thing needs to be rewritten. The assignment was to decide on what the future of the book will be and give a 300 word explanation of it, followed by why you think that society is leaning in the direction of your chosen mode of literary media. To me, your assignment just seems to tell of how you've done some research on your family history. Perhaps you should read through the assignment prompt again, as I think that you may have been confused as to what we were supposed to write about. Maybe I'm so wrong and I've completed the assignment incorrectly, but mine follows the same guidelines as the other four I've just critiqued.
 
 
 
 I hope you don't find my response as rude, would just rather tell it to you straight as you have an opportunity to fix your assignment before you turn in the final draft - that's a good thing!"
"The description falls short, not just in word count, but in its aim to make me want to go out and read this book immediately. Vegan or not, the book should make me want to see what makes it different, how it can be a ""future"" book. I think with a little more explanation, this description could stand out more. Figure out exactly what makes Emily special to the vegan cookbook world. How is she innovative? If it's not just a cookbook, explain why."
"I really like how you pointed out, in the beginning of your explanation, that you do not think books will ever die. I think this is important because, it keeps in mind that yes, although documentary film is becoming an extremely popular way for information to be transferred, it is not going to replace the traditional method of exchanging information. It also allows for books to remain special and sacred, and to stay an outlet for those who want to ˜disappear into their own world. This being said, you make an excellent point in stating that film is very relatable as it is easy to SEE another individual, and thus experience aspects of their lives with them. I also think you did a very good job explaining the film and in explaining the intrigue and the value in its genre as a documentary."
"The only thing I think may have been too bold of a statement was when you said that ""film will always be more powerful than text"". I do think that this is a rather subjective statement, as many individuals absolutely become enchanted by and involved in a story when it is on page, because so much is left up to their own imagination. The voice and image of a character, the tone or the character's overall mood, the atmosphere of a building or of a place - and the beauty of written text, at least in fictional stories, is that my perception of a character will never match another's; yet, in a film, a character appears in a very straightforward way, with very little interpretation to the viewer. I think it very much depends on the genre, for one to say that film is more powerful than text. Of course, if a demonstration or learning technique needs to be taught, I can definitely see how film is the way to go. But as for me, I have always been more comfortable with text, as it is easy for me to segment, control, and become enveloped in a story. I guess my critique would be to clarify WHEN film is more powerful than text (as you did) instead of making a general statement that film is ALWAYS better, as many people may not feel this is true. But, other then this, I literally thought that what you wrote was perfect, and I think you posed wonderful points and thoughts - great job!"
"I think you did an excellent job of building up this book. You made the book seem very intriguing, exciting, and above all, futuristic. I have no idea how you managed to include pictures, but the pictures certainly did an amazing job of enhancing the work and proving your overall point. Through viewing the photos alone, and without reading any of your text, I got the feel that this book is incredibly different than other 'traditional' books, and in this I think you absolutely met the challenge of this assignment. I think that, in your final draft, your photos will do an outstanding job at proving your point. In addition to this, your writing was well-thought out, properly organized, and succeeded in dynamically building up the book you chose. Great work!"
"I believe that the author should make sure to be more clear about the fact that you can use this book in more ways than just reading through pages. Although e-devices were mentioned, I was still confused as to whether or not this type of book would be hand-held, on an e-device, or both. How will the book be accessed on an e-device - from a website? Will it be purchased and downloaded instantaneously, or ordered? Will it have any software that must be installed onto an e-device? While the author said that this book would be available for e-devices, I feel it should be more explicitly stated that it can fluctuate between being an experience through page or through screen, both, or neither, because I am still unsure as to whether this book can be read in the way a traditional book is read, or if that is not the case at all. Other than this, this genre of future books sounds exciting!"
"For the most part, the article is solid, even if the ""Description"" section is a bit short.
 
 
 
 My only criticism is that the article seems to only give vague examples as the girth of interactive activities that are available on Pottermore. For example, fan fiction--it's described as a hub for it, what does Pottermore offer that other fanfiction hosting websites do not? How is fanfiction integrated with other areas of the website mentioned, if there is any at all? 
 
 
 
 Also, because Pottermore is an online entity, perhaps it would be helpful to include links?"
"The links are very helpful for anyone who isn't immediately familiar with the app, and the Future Factor of the material is stated very clearly."
"While the links are certainly very helpful, the ""Description"" segment of the article seems to rely on them too much instead of making its own unique statement about what the app is and why the audience should be interested."
"The article is very well written and gives the reader a good understanding of the nature of the Pottermore website. Adding the detail about the site crashing on launch is also a great way to show that it's not just the author who feels positive about this sort of continuation of printed works in the digital realm, as is comparing it to other popular social media."
"The image provided doesn't seem to reflect the interactive nature of the website. Perhaps a screenshot of one of the activities described in the ""Description"" would be better?"
"The author does an excellent job of both describing the material, making it sound almost irresistible to readers, and explaining why this book exemplifies how technology will shape the future of the book. Providing the link to the material in question is also quite nice."
"It's a bit nitpicky, but ""I have selected"" is hardly necessary here. It would far more effectively to cut that out and stick with the basic summary of the work."
"The article is very well-rounded and addresses many valid points about blogs and how they reflect the changing nature of writing online, publishing online, and the closer interactions between reader and writer."
"In the future factor section, the field guide slips away from the pragmatic approach taken in the description and delves into an area of more idealizing than explaining this thing in the desired technical manner."
"Kudos for using futuristic implementations into the field guide, like the hyperlink to News from Gardenia's Unbound site and the picture. The Field Guide does well to sell its audience on News from Gardenia which is a book about the possibility of a utopian future. The author of the guide accurately and with concise but important detail, gives an accurate description of the thing they are writing on."
"Though Unbound, the crowdsourcing platform for book publishing is really the futuristic aspect of the guide we only hear about it once we get to the last section. Instead of describing News from Gardenia so thoroughly we should be getting a description of how Unbound will change the future of text."
"It is not made clear in the description if this resource can be used by someone reading the book for added effect to their reading experience or if it is simply intended that more condensed and interactive ebooks/websites will eventually replace books. I do not agree with the comment about ""the perfect book for the Twitter generation"". Such books and short versions of full-length texts already exist. An old example would be the novelization of the death of Superman and his eventual return. Roger Stern was tasked with novelizing the most popular comic book story arc in the history of the medium, titled ""The Death and Life of Superman"". It was so popular that DC Comics produced a more condensed novelization for younger readers, titled ""Superman: Doomsday and Beyond"" by Louise Simonson. Generally, readers go to books for a greater depth of information and storytelling, which they find immersive. It is usually film adaptations that go the more condensed route. I don't se how such an innovation could actually replace the modern book, until they provide the same level of information and storytelling, as well a similar practicality of use."
"I think the author of this entry effectively argued their point I do not have any criticism, other than that the ""future factor"" section was definitely over 150 characters."
"I think this entry could spend a little less time describing less relevant things (i.e., the first paragraph of the second section) and focus instead on simply and succinctly describing some of the features of Ideo. It would be interesting to have a quick summary of the features offered by the Nelson, Coupland, and Alice concepts. This would allow for further exploration of the specific benefits of each feature as they relate to different potential readers."
"Great choice of film! I love the documentary Babies, and I think you hit upon its main unique strength here in a very eloquent way. Rather than use text at all to communicate its message, it relies specifically on non-verbal cues and images throughout the film. I really like how you mention that if you glance away for a moment, you can miss a part of the story, as that is very true for that film and for so many social cues which are non-verbal. I think this brings up all sorts of great questions, because if this film is a sort of future book it seems more a type of oral culture than literary culture. Indeed, it would seem that almost all documentary films are, in a way, more a throwback to an oral culture than literary culture. I think you've hit on an interesting idea here."
"Some quick grammar edits I noticed:
 
 Film is powerful, and ""showing"" something to a learner is much more relatable that ""explaining"" something to a learner. -- that needs to be than.
 
 Babies cry when their hungry or uncomfortable and are not capable of fending for themselves. --their needs to be they are or they're.
 
 
 
 ""Film will always be more powerful than text."" This is a huge statement, and I don't think this one film or field guide backs up this statement. Your paragraph after this begins to argue that watching something on a page would be somehow better than reading words on a page, but you don't explain why. Probably I got bristled by this just because I'm a huge reader--for me, text will always be more powerful than film. But I think it might be easier to stick to this specific film, and say why this film is more powerful as a movie than it would be in book form. It is so much easier to prove a smaller point than a larger one, and the length limits for this assignment were so limited the space is really restricted to make a larger point.
 
 
 
 Also, I love your idea of a future book, in the third part, but the instructions read to describe what makes this specific item a future book. So again, I would maybe draw back to the movie Babies and talk a bit more about what the future factor of this film is. I think you could even move the last paragraph of your summary down to that third part, and get into a bit more of the movie's documentary aspect in the middle part, an exploration of the documentary as 'book' in the middle section.
 
 
 
 Oh, also I believe you need a pic! Somewhere in there. There were so many amazing shots in that film, I'm sure you can find a great screenshot online. Or, I'm not sure if this is possible with html but I believe it is, I bet you could link the trailer here from Youtube and use that as your pic? That might give readers the best idea of the film."
"Wow, this is definitely a double-future dose. Literally future-esque, as in its subject matter, and then the figuratively future-esque of the assignment, with the Unbound Publishing. I'm a big reader and I hadn't heard of Unbound, so very cool!
 
 
 
 I love your description of the book, as you point out right away what makes the subject matter of the book unique--the isn't the same old dystopian novel, but a utopian novel where we aren't all subject to the same old gloom and doom. You point out the book's effects, that it has the ability to inspire people to make a better world, which I think is also important to make people want to run out and grab it. They know what its about, but what is it going to make them feel? So in several ways, you've found a very unique book. 
 
 
 
 I also appreciate that you are concise. In English classes I think we tend towards fancy language without saying a lot, and I think you use direct language here which conveys your message with the clarity the assignment wanted, something I know I had a hard time doing myself."
"Some quick grammar fixes I noticed:
 
 ""two hundred years in the future to a world that is recognizable yet alien""--I don't think this is grammatically wrong, I'm not sure, but I feel like ""two hundred years into a future world that is recognizable yet alien"" might read a bit smoother? Totally up to you, of course, but I just wanted to throw it out there.
 
 ""Truly a novel that inspires the reader to at least acknowledge that sustainability and human equality is possible.""--This sentence doesn't have a subject, I think it might make more sense to say ""Lllewellyn has written a novel that truly inspires the reader to acknowledge that sustainability and human equality is, at the very least, possible,"" or something like that. That authors name has so many L's!
 
 
 
 I don't have too much other constructive feedback, I think your choice of novel and why it is a future book is so right on. I guess maybe your title could be a little more powerful, but that is me straining for some more feedback to give you, to be honest. I think you have room to add some more descriptors in there, which might hook the reader in a bit more and pull them down into your assignment--your summary is so intriguing, but your title doesn't match that. Maybe: ""News from Gardenia by Robert Llewellyn is a utopian science fiction novel created, in part, by its readers.""
 
 
 
 Also, I'm not sure the sentence where you say you feel disloyal saying it isn't from the future is very clear. The whole wording of this part has to be sort of awkward as we're talking about a ""future"" book, and so it is awkward to figure out how to take about that, but you are saying it is from the future, right? So maybe ""This is from the future because"" because you aren't saying it isn't from the future? Does that make sense?"
"I think you need to pick a single specific book or other media source in existence today (game, choose your own adventure book) and describe that. I'm sure there is something out there that fits your description.
 
 
 
 You mention Phantasy Star in your summary, so if you choose to focus on that, I think your title should explain Phantasy Star, your description should explain Phantasy Star, etc.
 
 
 
 I gave examples of the Role Playing Book above that I could think of off the top of my head but the book that has always reminded me of a Choose Your Own Adventure Novel is Italo Calvino's If on a winter's nite a traveler... so you may also want to check that one out? You don't choose your own path in it, but you, as the reader, are written into the book.
 
 
 
 Also, I think you could compare Choose Your Own Adventure Novels to hyperlinks on the internet. Really, when we browse the internet, we are choosing our own adventure with each click. Instead of flipping to a different page in the book, we are moving to a different web page online. But until you focus on a single item, I don't think this assignment is done correctly."
"I was so interested in this that I looked it up online, and it looks like you took some of your info and text ""The team looked at how digital and analog books currently are being read, shared and collected, as well as at trends, business models and consumer behavior within related fields."" straight from their website? Bummer. It is important not to do this, as you will for sure get in trouble for it. If you have any other cut/copied text in there, get it out of there because Prof. Finn said he would run this through plagiarism software and it will catch this.
 
 
 
 What you want to try to do is read the web page, think about the information and process it, but say it in a completely different way. Or if you still want to say it in exactly that way, you need to attribute it to the web page.
 
 
 
 I think this is a lot to write about, as it sounds sort of overwhelming and complicated as three different book-related technologies. To me, it would be more digestible to just approach it from Alice, since you said that was the more interesting one. That way, there may be less pressure to summarize so much of what the company is doing, and it might be easier to just explain the technology of Alice itself?"
I think that the entry did not fall short and the reader was convinced that the digital books and society adapting to modern technology will enhance the demand to want digital books. I think maybe explain his question at the end.
"First of all, there are certainly some typographical errors that are easily corrected, such as ""individuals over the age of 18 who do not has doubled."" I assume that is meant to read ""over the age of 18 who do not READ has doubled"". 
 
 I believe that this field guide would also benefit from more focus. Rather than focus on the technology of podcasts or audioblogging, I would like to see how a specific podcast functions and demonstrates the way forward. The author does mention one work, ""99% Invisible"", but it is given as an example of the form rather than being the focus of the field guide. 
 
 This follows in the ""Future Factor"" portion of the response. Rather than focus on how the podcast points the way to the future of books, the author instead digresses on an unrelated tangent. While it's certainly interesting information, thoughts on book distribution, government censorship, etc. don't seem to have a place in this particular assignment. 
 
 I believe the primary changes that need to be made are in organization. Focus on a single work, demonstrate how the form is superior (or at least the way forward) and finally why this constitutes the future of the book."
"I may be wrong in this assessment, but I believe that the ""description"" aspect of the assignment was to be less focused on the content of the novel and more on what makes the novel different from other novels. As the author notes, the content itself isn't unique in that sense. I would suggest refocusing the ""description"" on the process of the publication, rather than the content. That way, it would clear-up plenty of space in the ""Future Factor"" section to discuss how this process shows us a way forward in the future of the book."
"I'm not certain the author adequately explains the benefits of the ""lack of borders"". There is mention that ""the visual style of this story goes hand in hand with its format"" but not having read the work I'm not sure what this means, aesthetically. Likewise, ""it takes the act of reading a story and makes it almost into a film strip"" does not indicate why this is necessarily a positive development, or one that can be expanded to other works. 
 
 There is also some confusion that seems contradictory, such as ""some hosting sites have shrunk the pages down to a more ""normal"" size"", suggesting a traditional page layout, yet the author also says, ""it simply could not have been published in the old media"". A few lines clarifying this apparent contradiction would be helpful. 
 
 Overall, a focus on the effect of this borderless approach with this book, as well as ideas on how it could be beneficial in the future would be helpful."
"I have very few criticisms of this work. Perhaps it would be beneficial to distinguish between these sorts of websites and an ""ordinary"" website dedicated to a particular piece of fiction. For example, would the myriad of fan-made websites be considered a part of this expansion of the book, or would it be limited to author-run websites?"
"My only critiques are grammatical ones. In your summary you saidpeople can subscribe to as many different ones to follow and read each entry. You have a strong voice throughout your entry, however this sentence feels awkward and could be rearranged so I it feels more cohesive with the rest of the entry. 
 
 Then, in your description, when you saidto skydive out of a plain, plain should be plane. 
 
 Thats all I got :) great job!"
"My only critique is a grammatical one. In the description when you saidA animated and interactive telling of the books, a should be an. 
 
 Thats it :) great job!"
"Um...well...I really don't have much. What can I say, you did a great job. I guess you could give us a quick line describing what the story is about. I think that could make your description stronger."
"Your description was excellent, but I feel that your argument as to why this should be considered afuture book was lacking. To me it felt as if you were defending it against modern technology instead of embracing it as part of our future and where books are going. I think if you removed these sentences it might help alleviate that defensive stance:Scanimation books are impossible to recreate in digital format. If one was to do so, it would entirely devalue the retro novelty and simply exist as crude animation, like an animated gif.""
 
 
 
 Also, in your description, when you said11 Iconic Scenes from a Galax Far, Far Away¦ Galax should be Galaxy."
"Your summary is very unclear. Even in your description I wasn't entirely sure where you were headed. I didn't fully understand what your entry was about until I read the ""Future Factor"" section. Creating a clear summary and immediately describing what this ""Future Book"" actually is will strengthen your whole assignment tremendously."
"I thought the field draft was well written, however in terms of the book's future factor I would like to know more about why other books would follow suit. It is clearly stated what makes the book different now, but what makes it special enough to be the future for other books?"
I feel the student's entry for future factor could do without the first three sentences. The student could easily use more examples of how the podcast is increasingly popular and what advances it is already making as well as why it will be more popular later.
"When reading the future factor I would like to know more about why this type of format is a natural progression. Would certain people not find it tedious? It is true that it may be a richer experience for those who are willing to try, but in all honesty how many people are willing to work and read? We live in an age where easy access and fun at your fingertips is most popular. So what makes this book accessible and how will other books follow?"
"Perhaps the student could explain why it would be a good idea for Emily C. to have her work only accessible online. The student has done a great job explaining why it was savvy for Emil C. to use her online resources, but why not also publish in print? What about people who are still reading physical books and struggle with the digital age? How will authors like Emily C. ease the people drifting behind into the future of e-books and online videos?"
I think the references to Nelson and Coupland were unnecessary. I think Alice covered all your bases on this assignment.
"Future factor was weak. Reference to Konstantinou seemed only tangentially related. You seems do be saying podcasts are the future because publishing might be shut down...? Are you saying in the future, there will be no blogs? If there is no internet, how are the podcasts disseminated? I'm sorry, I was confused by this."
"Future Factor was strong, but it did not match Summary and Description. Future Factor section had a great idea for future book format and good points about how fast technology is moving."
Is the answer documentary films or a book with digital capabilities? You answered the assignment with two different forms. I would say stick with the latter and re-write #1 & #2.
"The persepective in section 2 confused me a little bit. It was almost more like a sales pitch or business case from the IDEO company than a field guide entry. I think the field guide entry should contain observations from an outside observer. I would remove the sense that the author has some sort of insight into the IDEO company motives for creating the programs and provide a more in-depth description of how the interface between the programs works.
 
 
 
 Section 3 could also use more objectivity. It reads like one who is partial to this particular program."
"My only criticism of this is that I would like the focus to be aimed more closely at the actual books hosted on Pottermore. The focus of the assignment should be specifically what constitutes the future of the book. The format of the books on Pottermore may be the way of the future. Maybe someday all books will be hosted on a centralized website, like libraries of the future, with interactive material being an expected requirement."
This entry falls short in providing an actual example. Describing all ebooks is too generic for a field guide. I would pick one and explain why the ebook is the future of books through the description of a particular example.
"I loved this entry. It is hard to come up with comments here; however, if I was to try to make an argument for the future factor of audio books I would cite the increase in handheld smart phone devices, blue tooth car interfaces, and other technological advancements which make audio books easier to consume.
 
 
 
 I would be very surprised if there wasn't readily available data regarding a correlation between increase in tablets and audio book popularity."
"The description section could be a little bit longer. After reading it, I was still wanted to know more. I would also discuss the history of children's book, and how they have progressed briefly that way there is a comparison with the future."
"The summary of the book could be a little more specific. What formats are you talking about? The description section, while it is well-written, seems out of place for this assignment. The only futuristic thing about this book seems to be the plot line, until it is explained that it is a crowdsourced book. The author could speak a lot more to the futuristic elements of that, as oppose to a summary of the book."
"This entry could do more to find the futuristic nature of the book. Specifically, the line, ""This additional element of art makes the book futuristic as well,"" doesn't really make sense because art has been incorporated in books for thousands of years. What/how will we be living that makes this book so applicable to the future?"
"This entry falls short in two ways. First is a summary and description. I was confused for almost all the post as to what reddit is. Even once I followed the link, I was unsure as to what exactly its function is. There needs to be a more concise explanation as to what it is.
 
 The second way is in its contempt of the book. There are people who will more than likely be offended by how callously the author has decided to write of the importance of books. Maybe by explaining why they think reddit will replace physical books and bookstores, the reader will have better insight as to why the thought is replacement versus growing alongside them."
This entry falls a bit short in the summary section. I think it might be the grammar in the first sentence that throws me a bit off as to what the actual product is. This is better described in the second section and there is a moment where the concept is clarified in my mind as a reader.
"I really wanted to see pictures! I loved the description of the book itself, but I wanted to actually see something instead of just reading about the aesthetics of the book. Also, this definitely needs a more concrete title. The title seems as if this was submitted on accident or out of confusion. Also, please remove ""the subject of this entry"" because that is self-explanatory."
"I think a way to really improve this would be to include videos in this entry. This field guide is an online field guide, so it only makes sense to provide links to videos that would help show how documentaries will be the future of the book. 
 
 
 
 ""Take for example"" in the summary doesn't fit with the rest of the assignment, it is self-explanatory. Also, choose what you want your focus to be on- do you want it on ""Babies"" or on documentaries as a whole? If you choose to focus more on ""Babies"", then include it in your conclusion of how this is a future book. If you choose to focus on documentaries on a whole, then I would omit the reference to ""Babies"" and include clips from different documentaries to prove your point."
"I really enjoyed the description of how Gaiman reads the script of the book. I thought the summary was straight and to the point as it should have been - easy to understand and immediately know what I was going to read about. As someone familiar with Gaiman's style, but who has not listened to this book, the description of his ""acting"" skills piqued my interested in the project and made me go and physically look up the project online after I finished reading the entry, so I feel that that aspect of the description was well done. It was also helpful to find out a bit of the background of the book, which unlike many other stories is very unique. (which was also an aspect of the assignment, just as the voice of the piece and attempting to motivate people to go and read the piece was). I also felt that the last line of the future section was particularly effective and was a lovely way to end the section by tying in themes of the Gaiman's pieces."
"While I like the ideas and direction of the ""future book"" entry, I think it would benefit from a slightly stronger focus on how this can shape the direction of books and readership. The author mentions that this idea could be applied to other books and other genres, it would be worth it to consider how one could do so, how could authors make the interaction for books uniquely individual like Rowling did, and what will that do for reading - will being able to participate in such and interactive and immersive world drastically change how people read? There are several interesting and unique applications this type of site has to books in the future and I think the analysis of the future section could benefit from some slightly deeper analysis to truly convince readers how this could change reading forever."
"I would really have liked to see the author expand the ""asthetics"" portion of the description section. The general descriptions of what users can accomplish on Pottermore is direct and well written, but I think those not familiar with the site would be more intrigued if the author were to mention what the site looks like, how its set up (use of the sorting hat and the house systems with quizzes and games, common rooms to interact with other users in, the easter eggs in the interactive sections of the novels etc). This set-up is part of the large appeal of Pottermore and is crucial to it's success as an interactive site, so I feel that some attention does need to be given to it's physical appearance and practical uses in the description section."
"The weakness of your paper is that you started off strong regarding Emily C. however finished somewhat generic with discussing an entire realm of futuristic literature. I am conflicted here because I do feel that the information you stated was important (one of the strengths I listed above) yet, I think you should find a more solid connection with Emilys journey. You mentioned that she was not associated with a publishing company, did she attempt to be published? Was publication a more difficult choice to spreading her story than e-book? I believe the convenience of publication online could be discussed, wherein that is also important to why she most likely decided to go this route, publishing a book is a confusing and long journey, yet the instantpublishing online does the job; thus the reason for so many disappearing bookstores."
"The description isn't very accurate because it seems that the walker mostly runs at the same speed. I mostly see green squares of where the walker was, but every once and awhile i'll see a red one. The colors don't seem to clearly show a difference in speed for me. The walker seems to mostly be walking the whole time instead of running."
"Good job. The walker matches the description pretty well. I think it's interesting that the rectangle can only move in four directions rather than diagonally as well. It wasn't noticeable at first, but it's different from the class example. I also like the color changes."
"It basically does. Though, there's not food. :/
 
 
 
 
 
 Also, I noticed that there was nothing to keep them from going outside of the window."
The motion that I see matched the behavior in Question 2 because the movement of the character goes to the bottom left and then stays idle.
"The motion perfectly matched what was written in the second question. The fly changes states every 2.5 seconds, and it has the four different actions. The only thing is that it wasn't a rectangle, but as the student wrote, the ellipse just looks better."
Yes it does. The fly seems to move in random patterns every few seconds and has several different behaviors.
"The description fits the behavior, for the most part; it does resemble lighting in slow motion. Though, it does not really look like it was changing color on my screen."
"The motion is similar to the way it is described in the description. The squares do move similarly to a lightning bolt, although I don't actually see the color changing like the author suggests. It's also a little weird to say it's repeatedly trying to hit the ground. That illustration of the animation seems a little forced."
"it does. What I would change about it, though, is that I would reset the squares on random points of the width as well. This is because when life sets you back, it can either be a little or a lot. Also because after a while, one side of the screen is left blank, making it look kind of lopsided. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 P.S. When I played it at first, it shaped out would looked like a running fox with a flaming tail. Thought that was cool."
"Umm, how does that describe the behavior of the walker object? This isn't supposed to be an artists statement but a description of the behavior of your walker object by using some behavior that is found in the natural world or described through a character of some kind. The Sporadic adjective does kinda work since the movement seems random, but I would really try to make your object link to something in life besides a square."
"The motion fits the description in terms of it moving wild and sporadically, however, your description seems a little vague or open for interpretation. It might be a bit of a stretch to say the motion mimics us fighting for what we want."
"I do not believe the motion matches the description. Perhaps the speed needs to be decreased, it is not visible when the rectangle is standing still to save energy - there seems to always be movement. However, I do notice when the rectangle is moved 30 units away from a point."
The description and behavior definitely match though there isn't really a story behind it. Maybe the spiral represents a bug flying in a spiral towards the screen but then dies cause it hit the screen. However I really love the coding you did for this. It looks beautiful.
"Your description of what is occurring is not done in the way that was asked. You did describe it correctly, but just not as a character in a movie. However, the creating of spirals is really cool and entertaining to watch."
"I really like the creativity in the description. I think the description was made to fit the animation, but I feel it works here. The animation does display the erratic behavior of the scenario you presented. Visually, it is very fun, although the rapid switching between grays can be a little displeasing to watch."
"Simple and straight to the point, this patch was fun and easy to use. The primary sound was simple but slightly annoying (perhaps like a good 'no' sound should be. The surprise of the 'yay' when I found the yes key was extremely pleasing and the the fireworks certainly added a cool surprise."
"Simple structure but effective, the added graphics were great but unexpected because they had not come up in class as an option within the creative process of this software. Seems like I am learning a lot about what the possibilities for more user friendly interface design. My only critic was that the buttons at the bottom could have been lined up more symmetrically."
It's wonderful. The sounds are entertaining and grasp the meaning of positivity and negativity.
The approach is perfect. I learned that UI and presentation mode in Max is very critical to developing a successful patch.
"The header is very creative, presenting the challenge of attempting to locate the good key. It presents a nice, inviting title and lays out the challenge before you while still being minimal. The master sound button is a great idea, saving the viewer a little time by not having to scroll down and switch each individual sound button on. The logistic part of the patch, though, is much the same as we were presented in class, with a little extra fuddle and detracting clunkiness included."
"Once the master sound button has been toggled to active the process becomes as simple as pressing different keyboard buttons until the right one has been pressed.; in this case it is ""P"". The sounds are clear in relaying to the user the information of the keyboard button, good or bad, but seem like stock audio samples that lack originality and are devoid of personality infusion on part of the programmer. The design is nice, but the sounds aren't entertaining to hear repeatedly, so after two/three times, I stopped the program."
"The introduction of the header and master audio switch is a novel idea that is aesthetically pleasing and improves immensely the ease with which the viewer can control the program and use it correctly. The presence of the links between the different objects, necessary as they may be, slightly detract from the quality of the header and switch button. The actual working part of the program seems slightly clunky due to the zigzagging wires crossing through one another and the yes/no button signals. The organization of the patch elements and including more novel sounds will make the patch perfect."
"While I was using this patch, I was very confused by the good key and bad key sounds. The sound for the bad key element did not sound as negative as I would want it to be. The good key element, with the sound being a bell ringing, was a good choice for determining what the good key was but, the choice for the bad keys was questionable with it being just a simple drum hit."
"The patch is very simple to use, but overall not very user friendly. For example, in order for the patch to work the user must load the clips and then turn on the sound. Adding some comments would help the user know what to do. PS! Thanks for not using the most annoying failure sound!! A lot of other patches use really annoying failure sounds and, since you end up hearing it over and over it gets really annoying. So thanks for using something that's not horrible!"
"It has a logical flow, but there are two ending speakers that it can lead to. This could have been simplified. There is only one comments, and it is not specific enough if the person is unfamiliar with the program."
"There are two ending speakers/end points. This could have been simplified to making it only one speaker. 
 
 
 
 They could have left in the comments what key number 100 is."
"The patch works perfectly, the D key plays back a ringing bell while all the other keys play back a snair drum."
My experience with the patch is that it's very goofy. It was difficult to find the key because it wasn't a letter. So I just pressed every key till I could find it.
"No, while the assignment was very organized and clean, they didn't really do anything exciting. I didn't learn anything from it. They couldve added extra sounds to make it better."
"Simple coding like in class, nothing different other than the sound files and the correct key. The comments on the side somewhat gave away the correct key though. I mean, I know it was there for the coder's purpose but for someone who did not know and was trying to figure it out, I would have renamed the sound files to something more incognito as well as the comment."
The folder wasn't labeled so I had to open it to see who files I was looking at. The patch was very simple and clean. There are a couple of toggles that I didn't see the purpose for.
"When running the patch, I couldn't get the sounds to play unless I clicked the ""ezdac"" object. This may be a Max thing though, so I wouldn't discredit the creator for it. Prior to critiquing, I had been listening to music, so when the evil laugh played, I actually jumped a little in my seat because it was so loud. I got a laugh out of it, and smiled fondly when I found the right key and recognized the Beavis and Butthead(or what I assumed them to be) laughs. The sounds are goofy with a touch of terror that still has my heart pumping a bit from the surprise. One thing is for sure, I'll be turning my sound down a bit when moving on to the next critique."
"The patch was pretty standard in terms of technical setup. It followed the tutorial correctly. As mentioned above, the maniacal laugh was pretty surprising. I cant imagine what people with headphones might have done. The sounds chosen did get a bit annoying after multiple key presses, so using multiple laugh tracks might help with the monotony that tends to occur after multiple attempts. In the future I might suggest labeling your files with your name or some kind of identifier - especially if an instructor is going to be looking at it."
"I like the simple layout and the description used to navigate the user into understanding the patch and what it does. They approached it the same way we approached it in class whereas one key is good, and the other key is bad. They could have made more good keys."
The good key is pretty entertaining with the beavis and butthead laugh.
"Looks similar to the example in class, easy to follow, uses the open features along with the names of the files."
"It feels like the 'no' feedback sound is too long and drawn out, yet the 'yes' sound is great and entertaining. It leads to a really annoying experience until I get the right key."
"After playing with the patch, I thought it was fun. I liked the user's sounds a lot. I could tell the user is a goofy person because when you found the good key, it played the ""oooh-yeah,"" from Ferris Bueller's Day Off."
The patch was neat and organized. But a few of the pieces like the buttons didn't need to be there.
"There was some key hunting, and the 'no' sound, which was from Sonic, was a little grating to the ears after a while because of how loud it was being played. The 'yes' sound highly amused me, the victory sound from any given Final Fantasy game. It did feel like a victory after finally finding the 'good' key. It was a nice experience overall."
"Technically, it wasn't anything complicated, and nothing experimental about it. Because of how simple it was, I didn't learn anything new and nothing jumped out at me. Which is fine since the path to each part was laid out to where it should be. Maybe adding a level meter in just to give the user an idea of how loud everything is, and possibly making sure before using a sound that it's not too loud for the user. Other than that, it was a pretty good patch."
"The bad key is bad indeed, it makes you want to hurry and find the good key. Now the good key is rewarding, I do believe it is from a video game and I cannot recall which but hearing it makes me feel as though i just beat an intense level of some sorts."
"I had trouble figuring out what I was supposed to do. The directions were a little too cryptic for me, and while I might just be too new at Max, I feel like the average beginner might have been as confused as I was. The sounds were kind of hard to understand as well. I could barely tell what either of them were saying - if it hadn't been for the note, I don't think I would have made out the ""amen"" correct key sound."
"I learned how to select multiple keys/values using the select object, which was something I was trying to do when creating my patch, and for some reason I just couldn't get it to work. Despite my confusion, I think this person did a pretty good job on the assignment. They achieved something completely unique to what I have seen so far. My one suggestion would be to find clearer and possibly shorter sounds."
"I think that the patch that you made is pretty clean, and unique. I didn't see the selective key in that which is an excellence idea to hide it."
"I think that the coolest thing of your work is that you used the sub patch, so you are able to hide the ""Good key"" form the user."
"The functionality is simple to use, which is great. There was a voice recording of the word hallelujah and a voice recording of word your wrong. Even when I had my volume on high they were still hard to hear, and the word, ""your wrong"" was very hard to make out. I think the simplicity of the words chosen is good because it is obvious as it relates to this project. I feel the user experience would be straight forward in terms of the literal, ""good key/bad key"" assignment."
"The patch is clear and easy to use. I like that there is a button that I can press to activate the wav files instead of hunting for thegood Key, or an ascii code map. I like the meter and the level meter attached to the sfplay object, it helps to know that the sound is playing."
"It is cute and funny. I like that the bad key sound is ""aint nobody got time for this"" and that when you find the ""good key"" it rewards you with a strongyea!. The sounds were very fast and clipped very tight. It made it feel abrupt."
The first thing I noticed was there were no comment boxes. The coding was not complicated but instead met the minimum requirement and was straight forward.
"I like the patch, it is clean and simple. I like the color sound meter."
"It is small and compressed, which I like, but the opening window was very large. It it clean and well placed, easy on the eyes. However, there are no comments, which would make it difficult to follow."
The sounds didn't work for me at first and I had to mess with the live.gain~ function before it made any noise. The actual audio clips were nice and soothing.
"They used the live.gain~ operation, which I was unfamiliar with, so it's cool that they tried something different. But it didn't play sound at first which is basically all it needs to do. They are also the first person who didn't have the YES key blatantly showing, so that's great."
i couldn't get it to work with keyboard buttons just the on screen buttons but i liked it still and the sounds were simple yet effective
"Did not work. There was no operator to select a good or bad key. The wav files were pleasant to listen to, a soft ""hello"" and ""goodbye"" with a very nice voice. It made me want to use the patch but I could only press the open operator to make the patch play a sound."
The patch looks well organized though I am not entirely sure the purpose of the boxes that say what is.. and awkward. It is easy to understand the flow of the code.
I could not get the sound to work with the keyboard. Only by pushing the open buttons on the patch. I am not sure if this is a problem on my end though.
"Sounds were entertaining, I enjoyed the ""whoosh"" a bit more than the ""yes and no"" shown in the example."
"Using the patch, I didn't ever feel like it wasn't working well, however, I was not really engaged. I didn't truly enjoy searching for the ""good key"" because the sound font didn't draw in my interest. This lead to a one-dimensional experience as in, I was just observing the functionality of the patch."
"The patch is laid out well, and looks nice. There are lots of comment boxes and everything is a nice distance away from is each other."
"I think you did a good jobs, and also picked a really funny music. The most impressive thing in your project is a decibel meter to measure the sound, however I think that you might be able to do something more creative."
"This patch is neatly arranged. I noticed that in addition to the regular meter, they also had a level meter, which was new."
"I think the sounds used where really unique. I was thoroughly amused by both the Spongbob and Austin Powers soundbites. I seem to enjoy the projects that can make me laugh more than the others, and this one definitely did the trick. The patch was straightforward and easy to use. I found myself searching for the right key even though it was outlined in a comment, just to keep hearing the sounds."
"Aside from the sounds and extra meter, I'd say this patch was pretty run of the mill. I didn't really see a use for the extra meter, but it did add a little extra visual component to the project. One thing I think could be improved is that there was a little extra length of ""noise"" at the end of the yes soundbite and that probably could have been trimmed off."
"The yes sound nice, but the no sound is the sound that most macs make when pressing a wrong key so I was confused for a second. That was clever actually. 
 
 The buttons lit up in different colors, that was a good idea."
"Nothing here really surprised me, I liked the colors on the buttons. And the sound choice made me think I was not even clicked on Max so yeah that was a good idea."
"The sounds were entertaining to listen to; ""Funk.wav"" was pretty funny to listen to."
The patch overall worked perfectly and it was amusing and it follows the assignment just right when it comes to requirements and layout. I actually did learn how and where they acquired the sound bar from because i could not find that for my project which i know would have been helpful for those who maybe could not hear it.
The patch didn't feature a comment telling me which key was the right key. I was forced to push buttons in an attempt to find the right one and the no sound became annoying. I didn't really enjoy the search because of the no sound.
"They seemed to have decided to just stack the codes on top of each other which worked. I think comments would have made for a better experience, so I could test the patch quickly without having to google the right code. I would have added the comment boxes for faster testing."
"Since it was condensed in size, it definitely took more time to find the right key(S), PLURAL. It was definitely surprising because I literally went down the rows of keys trying to match the numbers. I learned that to be sneaky and troll people, don't show all the connections so that people can get frustrated and slam their keyboard...no I didn't do that.."
"I would have liked more notes and the whole thing just seemed a little crammed together. There's space! Use it! There's also a number box with a -127, and I'm not sure why."
"I only got one of the sounds to trigger - the ""no."" The Ace Ventura sounds were cool and all, but only if it actually works."
"So, the ASCII code for their selected value is 22, but that doesn't actually correspond to a keyboard input, so it didn't actually function in the way I would hope."
"The patch looks very good, and is condensed a lot. But still looks like it took some technical abilities to make."
"The patch is very simple, but the creator could have added a few things to make it easier to the user. Firstly, comments that tell the user to turn on the sound, for example, would make is user friendly. Secondly, adding a few features like the ability to pick the ""success"" key would be a great feature for this patch."
"The sound was sort of boring at first...but then I found the ""yes"" button and it made me laugh for quite a while, good use of the file."
The patch itself gives off a very good feel. It was not as clear as some of the others and at first it looks like they may have missed a step but they just simplified it to the very core.
I really liked this patch. It was super creative and the sounds were perfect. The good key sound is one that continues on its own for quite some time so its as if it is actually speaking to you and I personally thought it was very funny. This particular patch makes me want to try harder and make more creative and funny sounds.
"Basic concept, kind of monotonous and it took me while to find the 'yes' key! The redeeming factor was the 'yes' sound was crazy and strange and interesting which made it worth the wait."
Nothing new from what we did in class and they layout could have been a little tidier. May have been cool to add some graphics? A good reminder that we need to push our creativity if we want to come up with something truly original!
"I was not able to get the patch to run. However, the description that was provided makes the patch seem like a very neat idea. I liked that the idea was musical and hope to see something like this that works."
"The patch was approached as expected. However, the way that they used musical elements was particularly interesting."
I could not get your keys to open and play. When I unlocked it to check if they were linked to a file by double clicking on it nothing happened.
"Right off the bat, I noticed that there would be more than two sounds that could possibly be played, and probably some at the same time. No descriptions to how the sounds can be made by each part, but from looking at it one can guess what's going on with it."
"I honestly could not get it to play anything. I can open each .wav file in the folder to find out what I'm supposed to hear, but I can't replicate that in the patch. There also wasn't a level meter, so I had no idea if sounds were actually playing or not, or if there was a problem on my end with my speakers. I really wanted to know if I could play 'Sweet Home Alabama'."
"There was a really cool and neat idea in the patch that somehow along the way didn't come through. I don't know if something had a wrong path, or something. I did see two message boxes before the speaker, so I don't know if that was the problem or not. The idea was exiting, but sadly I couldn't hear it."
"Visually logical and simple, including colored buttons indicating ""correct"" and ""incorrect"" input."
"Nicely laid out, and the two buttons, one for 'yes' and the other for 'no', are color coordinated for the user's convenience. Everything is labelled, and even which key is the 'good one' is spelled out as to leave out the guess work."
It is easy to use though I had to do some guessing to find the good key. I enjoyed the futuristic sounding files and it reminded me of space mountain. It would be well used with some kind of space ship cockpit.
I think they completed the assignment as asked without adding a lot. The buttons are a nice addition to see which side your typing is going through. It adds a good visual cue in addition to the audio output.
"This one was actually a lot of fun! I loved how the good key's sound started off the same as the bad key's. I can definitely see someone just pressing the keys one after another and completely missing the sound, which is amusing to imagine. The sounds overall reminded me of the inside of a sci-fi movie spaceship."
This patch looked a little to clumped together. I think it would look more clear and professional if there was more space in between each of the keys. I also don't see the a button that explains the letter that represents the good key so I'm unsure which key to hit.
"This patcher followed all the right rules and components of this assignment. I still suggest spacing out the buttons/keys to look better and cleaner. In this case, I would also advise on stating which key is the good key for the sake of time for this critique assignment. But it still played the sounds and functioned perfectly."
The sounds are entertaining. It's a bit confusing that the sound is used for both good key and bad key. At first it made me think I had pressed both keys or there was an error in the way it was coded. I then realized the same sound is used within the good key sound as the bad key sound. It's very easy to use and navigate.
"The experience was OK. The sounds were fairly interesting although it was a little confusing. For some reason I though the wrong key was the right key, but that just may be how I took the sound effect."
"Like I said before, it was done very simply. Which is always good. The simpler the better. However, I kinda would have liked to see comments of some sort. If I had no idea what was going on, I would be incredibly lost. Honestly, I didn't really learn anything new from this patch."
the patch uses the same formula shown in class but adds more sound and key options.
"I'm still a little unclear about how this patch works. Instead of just one ""Good Key"" there are two different ""Good Keys"" which play two different sound files of trains. The ""Bad Keys"" play the sound of 2 more different trains that alternate back and forth every time you hit a bad key. I find this to be rather confusing because all four of the train sounds are very similar to each other and it's hard to comprehend which keys are ""good"" and which keys are ""bad."" In total there are 5 different sound files present in this patch, which I kind of don't understand. I wasn't able to hear the fifth sound, which apparently was a bell that was also supposed to match with a specific key."
"I appreciate the fact that Tom tried to do something different with his project and expand upon what was taught in class, but I do think he could have organized it better and chosen sounds that aren't extremely similar to each other. There is just a lot going on in this patch and I think it should have been simplified."
I'd like it better if things were more organized. I have to look in many different parts of the display box to see what is what.
The sounds are simple and not very entertaining in my opinion. The good key is kind of exciting but runs a bit longer than I'd like it to. The experience I get is just wanting to press many different keys over and over
"I liked the music patch of the good key, it went well with the symbol sound of the bad key. There was definitely a reward there for the effort to find the good key."
"I think that the patch that you made is really clean, and well organized. I also saw that you have a decibel meter to measure the sound, which is really cool to me."
"I think that the sound that you picked for the wrong key is really funny,and the one that you picked for the right key is really amazing, I was so surprised when I heard it, so I'm really enjoy using it."
"I think you did a good jobs, and also picked a really awesome music. The most impressive thing in your project is a decibel meter to measure the sound."
"I liked the samples used. Trying to remember where the sample for the ""good key"" is from. Sounds familiar."
