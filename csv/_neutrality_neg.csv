"In all of the projects, he or she discusses the use of lasers. Though the projects are very similar in their use of lasers, they are also fairly different ideas. The student made a good effort to expand upon their ideas and give details. They want one project using lasers as a form of data transfer, laser interactive project and another basic max/patch laser project."
"I feel the student elaborated enough to get o good idea of what they are aiming for.
 
 The first idea is to create some kind of musical instrument incorporating lasers.
 
 The second idea is to use lasers to send information to different devices they also stated that some of the technology may need to be further developed.
 
 The last idea is some sort of shooting game with lasers and a projector."
The first one the student wants to make is a music system which controlled by some unique instruments. The second one is to build anthropopathic robot soldiers. The third one is to build a virtual reality glove.
"If I were to collaborate with this student, I would try and find a good blend between using the oculus rift and glove ideas, with the robot army idea. They both are necessary for eachother, so I think that makes complete sense."
"These projects - a simple midi controller, soldier drones, and a video game glove - have all been proposed many times. We see these types of things all the time in movies, and occasionally in real life. It doesn't seem like the thinking was stretched very much, but that previous ideas were re-used."
"This student made a sincere effort in proposing the ideas, as each one feels thought out to the extent that they can be in such a short amount of time. The first idea was to make a midi controller, which seems to require hardware that is simple to make and some programming that this student is not confident in doing. The second idea was to make unmanned robots that function similarly to human beings, allowing soldiers to control one as if it was their own body without the risk of death. The third idea was a glove for virtual reality that can mimic the actions of the player, allowing the player to interact with the virtual world similarly to the real world, potentially with haptic feedback."
I like the idea of having an app that allows you to interact with a concert you are attending. I also like the idea of having sort of one central app that allows you to research and donate to causes around the world. I think that would be the best bet.
"The ideas feel somewhat proposed as they are, though I'm left with many questions as to how something would be made or how complicated it would be. The first idea talks about skills more than what can be accomplished. It seems that this student is not entirely aware of what they can do with their skillset, specifically due to lack of programming knowledge. The second idea is understandable yet I'm not sure as to how this would take a large amount of money and time. It feels like setting up an incredibly large and intricate information system, then giving that information to the user in a simplified format. The third idea is clear though the student does not write about how something like that is feasible; I feel that it's less of a technical project on the student's end and would mostly require interacting with and convincing the performers and producers at the concert to let them hook up things for the app to work."
"Seeing as how this student is very arts based with design, video, and music, I feel we could work well together as I do myself have many artistic qualities (I am also a musician) but I also have some programming experience to work on the more technical level. I think it would be possible to work on some iteration, if not the complete idea, of the third proposed project. We could probably achieve a basic prototype form through the use of Max MSP I would assume. We could blend their experience of live sound and my capacity to finagle Max."
"Rolling with this idea, the student and I could make an app that would allow people to rate and share experiences of certain routes or part of a city for use by cyclists. Users would record their experiences, along with a positive or negative rating, and link them to a certain area on a map of the city. Overall ratings for different areas would show up over time, giving both locals and visitors a map of safe biking routes and notable places to avoid."
"I am a cyclist myself and have designed my own apps on photoshop, so this actually is interesting to me. Maybe in the app include some of the traffic going on in areas and color coding the safety with the roads."
I believe that some solid effort was put into this by the student. The ideas were well thought out and put lots of variables into consideration with cycling. Cycling is a largely used mode of transportation so these ideas will most likely be successful.
"I like the idea of simplifying things like routes and safety in cycling. I think we could think up ways on how we could branch out with these ideas or even conjure up some more,"
"You have a great goal, to make cycling safer. If only you wrote down a few more ways to achieve this. A way to report dangers threw an app or something is a great idea. It would give cyclist a voice and push the city to make changes. What other ways can this be done?"
If I was your partner I think Id like to focus on researching the ways large cities are doing this. Id like to propose a way to physically make cycling safer threw lights that interact with cars and the roadways. If we could come up with a way to make communication easier for a cyclist while they ride I think that would achieve some part of your goal. If we could update a rider of upcoming dangers as they ride that would be helpful.
"I could definitely collaborate in making a video or board game with them, creating sketches or doing animation, and I think that would be a lot of fun, especially if it is combined with the other two ideas, into an interactive game, maybe for physical therapy or something. I wouldn't be able to do much with the VR part, but I could definitely help with design."
I could help to develop the visual representations for this world the AI will explore or meld with. But that's about all I'd have to offer to this project.
"I can imagine his/her project would be foundation stone for future project about the NCVR and AI. If he/she meet and collaborate with designers such as a visual, sound, and media installation person, this project would be great interactive gaming system. This project is quite impressive for me."
"I can tell that this student is very passionate about virtual reality, as am I. This NCVR sounds like an excellent idea (albeit a little risky) but it would definitely be the next step in VR. Visuals have been covered by systems such as the Oculus Rift, but that's as far as it goes (to my knowledge)."
"By the look of it, I think we could make a really good VR game together. The ideas and goals are all there, we would just need to work for a long time to reach those goals. Game are a huge part of my life so I could think of lots of ideas on how this project could take off."
I thing a projection based art project would be cool we could make some sort of projection mapping setup that allowed the laser graffiti to be made on a number of different objects.
This student mentioned wanting to do some kind of game and I wanted to do games and incorporate fitness and gaming. So with an arcade game we could find a way to make something that got the body moving. He also wanted to do something with generating power but with water. Well we could make a game that generated power based on body movement. That would be really fun.
"I am very interesting in the third idea. I am also like projecting mapping and interactive project. Base on your idea, I would like to do some ""gun"" game. The gun could have the laser in it, so when you ""shoot"" the wall, the wall will has a ""real"" black hole. On the projection mapping wall, we can create some visual effects that has strong connection with the gun."
"I love the idea of cars running on water. The change to the environment it would make would be spectacular. Also, the laser gun and light graffiti both sound really fun and artistic."
"We could probably make (with a bit of programming knowledge) an awesome game where, as it has been said, draw lines with lasers on a giant projected light wall. The fundamentals seem pretty basic for something that could turn out to be really cool."
"I would take idea number 2 because at least we both would be interested in some kind of reform in education funding. We could work on an artpiece that would show how our government allocates money. Since we would be tackling politics, having the funds of billions of dollars would allow us to say whatever is necessary, regardless of what corporations/people are offended."
"I mean, they didn't really propose anything for the first idea. Technically, they answered the actual question to the fullest, because it asked ""what could you yourself accomplish in a week?"" They said that with one week to do something, they could get the planning phase done, and start to draw up concepts to actually get a finished product. There was no idea stated. For the second, they gave more of an idea of creating a way to make higher education accessible to all those who wish to further their learning, but beyond that there was nothing. The same goes for the third idea, there was not a specific idea to state, but rather that it would be better to work in a group to get stuff done."
"Literally, it's almost impossible to get something done with this students ideas, because there is nothing to go off of. The only thing to go off of would be that we would be coming together for one cause."
"I do not believe that this student took much time and getting this homework assignment or really tried. There isn't much to be able to think about here, and although buying convertibles for everyone sounds like a good idea, it doesn't have anything to do with our major or creating something from nothing."
There is nothing I can collaborate with another student on because they didn't write enough idea down for something to be created in a partnership.
"My ideas involved animation, and this students ideas involved collaboration/team-building and taking on a major issue (College costs).
 
 
 
 So a joint project might take the form of an exploration of some major problem or concern, and an animation that enhances some aspect of our efforts or our reporting. It might be used to explain the problem, to explain a proposed solution, to explore the issue further, or report on the successes or failures of our efforts. In many things, including animation, a team usually make it easier."
I feel personally that I could help with the first idea of planning things and putting them into motion. One thing I could do would be possibly build some rough prototypical components of some ideas they have to gauge how it might function in a real life application.
"For your semester project goal, I think you might be onto something. Many freshmen come into college shocked at how different it is in comparison to high school, and thus, take a while to get settled down into their new world. Maybe you could construct a game that helps freshmen college student ""learn the ropes"" if it were to how to survive your college experience. Maybe tailor made to ASU instead of a general college survival guide, you could make games that illustrate how to use Blackboard or Ctitviz, maybe include a 3D map of the school in a racing game that subconsciously teaches you how to get around the school campus."
"This student did a great job at stretching their thinking. There are three ideas present, each with their own unique twist on them due to the limitations of either time or money. The first idea is a game, not sure what platform, that calculates reaction time of the user. It would be awesome to have further discussion on what this could be used for; personally, I see this mini-game being used for competition entertainment between friends. The second idea is a group of games used to encourage a healthy and fit lifestyle by using a reward benefactor to motivate people. The third idea touches briefly on the student's passion to expand their gaming company."
"In the past I have worked on classical compositions, musicals, and even post production for short films. In this case, I would love to use my skills in sound design, musical composition, and as a musician to integrate sound and audio into the experience of games. I would love to find a way to use sound in a way that it has never been used for in games to create a dynamic interactive experience in games. On a much more simple note, I would also like to create the theme music for this person's games."
As far as the description of the idea goes it does hit some points. I like the idea of the game for fitness. I'm a little confused about it being an video games or an physical game like sports? I like how it would incorporate on the physical aspect of fitness like using gym equipments for the workout. The incentive on accumulating points is also a great idea. I picture this idea as in the Wii Fit game but not augmented reality? An example on this would be helpful for a visual example.
I would like to work on this project because my idea is about fitness as well. If we can incorporate on kind of campaign about well-fitness and create an event or program that utilize this game I believe this project will be incredible project to work on. If people see there are incentives on exercising and also being fit because the ultimate goal is about fitness and seeing that it is fun to work out they would participate on the event/game.
"I like the idea for the graphic design that would get the world excited about helping make earth a better place to be. I have a similar idea that I think could go along this, adding social media capabilities, and getting as many people involved as possible."
"The first and third ideas - using hand-painted images for a wedding, etc. book, and educational games - have been done many times over. The second idea - changing the look of a building based on internal or external activity - seems like it could be done easily enough, and I don't know that it's been done before."
"There are three good ideas present, however not all answers have deeply thought out ideas. I love the ideas but I wish the student would have expanded on their ideas. The first idea is to create a first person shooter game. I like the idea of creating a map/level that can be added to a first person shooter game. It would be awesome to have a game that allowed the game community and its aspiring developers be the creation factor of the maps, levels, and content. The second idea is to build a gaming team to create video games that raise discussion on important topics/issues in the world. These games will also keep the traditional aspect of what a game is. The third idea would be to create an exploration game."
"As I said before, it would be awesome to have a game that allowed the game community and its aspiring developers be the creation factor of the maps, levels, and content. I would love to collaborate and work as the creative/business side of the video game design process. It would be great to work as a team to deliver content to existing games or even new games that promote community driven creation within games. This would give power to the game community, almost like an ultimate sandbox."
i could help with what goes on in the game. The story line or goal in the game.
"I think that you have a few good ideas about what you want to do, however I am a little unclear on both of them. 
 
 
 
 1) For the pistol device that you mentioned in idea 2: Why is it a designed to be pistol like? If you are worried about negligent or improper behavior in a community, why would you shape your device to look like a deadly weapon? Additionally, could you elaborate a little more on what you meant by patrol device? What makes it more or less specialized than a smart phone?
 
 
 
 2) For the mobile app: I too find it interesting to manipulate a mobile device to track social and personal habits. What kind of error proofing will you need to do in order to make sure the mobile app doesn't go off during every quiet situation? Also what kind of habits are you specifically attempting to track? The range of personal and social habits is a pretty broad range."
I would choose to help work on their mobile device application. Although I would try to specialize the app in one particular area like sound and the measurement of decibels. From there I could branch out into using gps tracking data in order to link connections between the decibel readings and the location of the device. This could be used to help find good study locations and develop better studying habits.
"The answer in the first idea is pretty vague. The writer seems more interested in putting down steps for developing an idea rather than actually conceptualizing a project. The second question is more thoroughly thought out and visualized, though there are some privacy and safety questions arising from the idea of a private autonomous, or at least mobile, surveillance system. The third idea is the most feasible, though I would fins it kind of irritating if my phone kept making personal comments about my habits and randomly playing music suddenly when it gets quiet."
"If the student is serious about creating an app, then maybe we could create a storytelling app with a significant visual element, like a web comic but with some interactivity. Maybe a choose your own adventure with dynamic visuals and some animation."
"I like the idea of using patrol devices, but this can be risky since I'm sure they will not be cheap and you have to worry about people messing with or breaking or stealing them. I also like the idea of creating an app as sort of a personal side kick."
I think these ideas are pretty well thought out and practical. The doorknob thing sounds kinda fun. Each of these ideas take the concepts and skills we're developing in DC and applying them in imaginative ways.
I'd love to draw storyboards for this person's Great Wall idea. The idea of displaying cultural history in a visually dynamic way is intriguing to me.
"These seem like a person's scribbled notes, and took me a little bit to decipher. They didn't think the ideas all the way trough to the presentation, just the general idea of it. To me its hard to visualize something if they don't describe the physical parts or generally explain how they would get it done and why it differs from the average idea.
 
 1. A computer program thermometer
 
 2. 3D printing research
 
 3. Virtual joust?"
"Using their supposed knowledge of Arduino, I would assist them in using the data they proposed in getting through temperature in their first idea in order to create a program that reacts to the temperature of bodies within the area. The more people there are creating more heat in the proposed area (that people would stand in), would affect an animation's speed. The colder it gets and as it is left alone, the animation would slow down as if being frozen in time."
I think that the student made some really good suggestions about creating a arduino program that has some sort of interactive aspect.
"I felt that although these explanations were brief, and could have used a bit more detail, the ideas were expressed relatively clearly in such few words. 
 
 
 
 Idea 1: A program that uses an arduino and three buttons. When a button is pushed, an assigned color appears. 
 
 
 
 Idea 2: A program that makes people feel as though they are part of a virtual reality world. The program would involve the whole body, and the user would feel as though they left the real world and were transported into the game. 
 
 
 
 Idea 3: A program that allows a person to drive a car or fly a plane using only hand movements."
"I really liked the idea of a video game that submerged the user into a virtual world. I think perhaps with a pair of virtual reality glasses, some sort of smart gloves and shoes, and perhaps some sort of outfit that had different sensors sewn into the material, this might be possible. This project would however, likely be very involved, and take a great deal of time and resources to accomplish."
I like your idea of building a simple arduino program with a simple sensor system to interact with the user.
"If I was to work with this student, then I would recommend that we create a system that tracks hand movements but instead of a RC car or plane, we would use a simple robot."
"I think it would be possible to use their hand movement idea and incorporate it into some kind of game, perhaps made in Unity. A possible idea would be to use the Kinect and have the camera track hand movements, and certain hand movements would control the character/plane/car in a simple game."
I think they tried to streak thinking somewhat. Their 3 ideas are - 1. An interactive system with arduino. 2. Make the matrix. 3. A digital physical system that tracks movement to control an RC device.
I think creating a system to track movement and turn that into to controls of an RC device or like a game or somthing would be fun. This has alread been done using the kinect or WII so a new cool way to do it would need to be devised.
"The project of most interest to me would be working to create a therapy program for children with special needs. I know little about this field, but I believe the project would require a great deal of research, and the creation of applicable audio and visuals."
"Given the intent of the assignment the student satisfied all the needs and was very thorough throughout the entire assignment. They had very clear purpose in the entire assignment and were very concise.
 
 In the first idea the student stated the steps that they would go through in order to complete a project in a week. In the second idea the student was very clear on what they would do with the money in the answer and what they would use the money for, and to create a machine for special needs children. The last idea was the student wanting to create a project that records brainwaves."
"This student definitely put a lot of thought into all of their project ideas. For the first idea, she goes into what she would do for the first week, such as planning, budgeting, getting the proper equipment, and meeting with professionals in the field she wishes her project to be in. As for the project itself, I'm not entirely sure what she is aiming to do. She wishes to use neural feedback, as well as feedback from a sensor that gets data from heartbeat. 
 
 
 
 For the second idea, it sounds like she would use the billion dollars to get a bunch of experts (in their respective fields) to help create a sort of therapy for special needs children. She would also have a bunch of equipment to show a progression of their healing/recovery. To me, it sounds like idea 2 is a further expansion of idea 1, which totally clears some stuff up for me.
 
 
 
 For the third idea, it's what has been going on for the previous two. Using data from the brain and the heart to get some sort of outcome. She was unsure of what is realistic for the time given this semester. She didn't propose three different items, but rather one idea that has different outcomes based on her time and money."
So the first answer didn't really say anything that this student could accomplish. It was all very vague and I couldn't figure out what the mobilemousecase project was.
If I knew what this student wanted to work on I would be able to gage what we could do together but I'm not sure what their interests are.
No they did not stretch our thinking. 1. No idea 2. go to Dubai 3. A mobile mouse case.
I like the Dubai Vacation for brainstorming. I feel that you need to have diversity and variety of locations to brainstorm ideas. If theres ever a trip like that count me in! As far as the mobile mouse case idea goes I think you should finish the product. I saw the pitch and the progress in the previous semester and it is an interesting product.
The only idea that you had was finishing up the mobile mouse case and it seems like your are really focused on getting this prototype finish I would like to collaborate on this product to get this finish if we had to work together.
1. The student said that he/she can finish lots of things in a week. But it depended on the resources. 2. Go to Dubai for brainstorming.3. Mobile mouse case! Sounds cool and I hope you can tell more details about it.
I don't know what mobile mouse case is. It sees like you can use your mobile as a mouse. Very interesting. Hope you can do it!
I would team up with this person and try to figure out a way to record and add video clips into a short loop composition that could be layered similar to how audio can be recorded and looped. I could just have certain opacities when I record 3-4 different clips and it would create something different and new every time to project.
"Some of the ideas were successful, and some weren't. I think their idea 2 was the strongest."
"The person didn't put too much thought into this one.
 
 The first idea is to create a small digital physical system or installation that looks cool.
 
 The second idea is to connect everyone by creating a internet infrastructure that uses solar/kinetic powered equipment.
 
 The third idea is to simply create a interactive mobile phone app."
"If we were to work in a group, I would try to blend the ideas of a digital physical system, the app, and the internet infrastructure to somehow create some sort of interconnected environment that is connected to all and is controlled by the phone app. This could be used to interact with others within the environment to do whatever the user wants. For example, if someone walks into the environment, I could trigger a device to turn on from my app on the phone."
I don't really feel like this student stretched the thinking on this assignment. The effort was barely made for this assignment.
I don't know what this student wanted to do so I'm not sure how we could collaborate. A game or installation is very vague.
"Maybe you could mix your first and third idea for a mobile application that interacts with your physical installation. People could download the app and answer a few questions (like what did you eat for breakfast?) and when they arrived at the installation you could scan for their device, pull their questionnaire, and projection map objects that correspond to them (like waffles if that's what they had for breakfast). The beauty of it would be that other participants in the installation would not know that you were to the one would had waffles, so it would provide a level of voyeurism to each of the participants allowing them to look into someones life without not who they were looking at."
"The student here is perhaps overly succinct, but seems confident that they can create something worthwhile over the course of the semester. I really like the idea of trying to increase and improve internet connectivity in this country. Other industrialized countries have bandwidth and speed that put us to shame. Replacing all of the old copper lines with fiber would be awesome!"
"If the student goes with creating a game I'd love to do character and concept sketches, storyboards and other visual aspects."
"Idea 1 is to make a graphic that they would paint on their motorcycle, from design to finish. Idea 2 is a movement to get people more active in the US. Idea 3 is app that connects motorcycle enthusiast to each other."
The app is a great idea because as far I know there are none out there for motorcyclist enthusiasts. For the project you could even combine the idea of graphics for motorcycles and use the app to share cool projects that people may be working on or want to collaborate on.
"I feel that all of their ideas could have been expanded upon, and I am not really sure what they had in mind for their second idea. What will this campaign to promote activeness entail? Would their be commercials and public events to help promote activeness? How will people commute to work? Will you design an Arcology and thus eliminate cars altogether? I could feel the sincerity behind their words, but they could have been a little more concrete with this desires, this would have helped in the clarity of their plans.
 
 
 
 Their ideas: 
 
 
 
 One Week: They would either design a decal or paint a mural on their motorcycle.
 
 
 
 Unlimited Time and Money: They wish to create a project that somehow makes people more physically active, they wish for this project to lower to usage of automobiles (and thus leading to less pollution and car related deaths).
 
 
 
 Realistic Semester: A social media app that acts like an internet forum for motorcycle rides and those who just generally love motorcycles."
I really do believe that this student made a sincere effort with this assignment and thinking about what they really want to do in these situations. I think that they really dug deep in thinking what they would want to do based off of what they love to do with their hobbies.
"I think that we could really collaborating on something here. For one, I love print design and working in Illustrator to create fun graphics, so I think we would be able to collaborate on motorcycle designs to possibly sell! 
 
 
 
 I also believe we could make an awesome animation for a health PSA, since I would want to do an animation for my answers last week, and they want do get the word out for people to be healthier, we could collaborate and make a really fun animated PSA about it, and with the money given to us, that we would be able to use it for advertising and getting celebrity endorsements."
I believe the student put in a lot of effort but I only seem to see two distinct ideas.
My DC concentration is insound so I would be very interested in finding a way to incorporate his sound project.
"I like your enthusiasm, and I would definitely work on a project with you if you brought this kind of attitude into a group project. I too would choose to work on a project that could extend beyond the classroom into helping the outside world with what I have learned within the DC program. Last year I worked on developing a garden that took care of itself with the help of an arduino. However this proved to be a really difficult project for only one person to work on, and was never completed to it's full potential. Therefore if you happen to stumble across an idea that your really feel passionate about, I would be on board to help make it happen."
I would like to start with the idea of the short film and trying to make the world a happier place. I feel that an inspirational short film can help the world or a group of people feel happier. What would we base it off of and what target audience would we push it towards?
Didnt go much in depth on any of the ideas. Pretty vague.
Not sure since I cant seem to figure out what the projects are exactly.
"The student actually made a sincere effort and I believe gave very honest answers, except for the third answer, the student didn't really answer the question or give an idea. The student actually clearly proposes two things, the first idea was about making an inspirational film, the second idea was about researching what makes a human happy without drugs, and to make a device that trains the human brain to think in a positive and non negative way."
"I believe that with the first idea is definitely something that both me and the student could work on. I love films and I love working on films, I think that could definitely be a fun project to work on with someone else, I also believe we could combine elements of the second idea in order to make an inspirational film about how people can be happy and train themselves to think in more positive ways."
"In the first idea, they clearly propose they would make a short film that was inspirational and intriguing to an audience. The only thing about this is, different people feel different emotions. What is intriguing to one person could bore the living hell out of another.
 
 
 
 The second idea is basically saying they want to make people happy! Without the use of any drugs. I fully support this idea.
 
 
 
 There isn't really a third idea, just the student saying that they want to work more with the development side of things."
"The student clearly proposes three separate ideas. For the first, the student's idea is for a short film. While they don't say what the topic will be, they do say that the short would not include explosions or CGI of any sort.
 
 
 
 For the second idea, the student would spend the money on something that could give clean water, or make self driving cars.
 
 
 
 The third idea was to create music."
"I think he/she seem like a visual artist and want to make project is related with visual things. However, it was hard to realize and imagine that is actual project that he/she want to make."
"Idea 1: a short film discussing a topic of interest.
 
 Idea 2: Work to organize and fund the creation of something that could provide clean water to people, or use a similar process for a different issue.
 
 Idea 3: Make music. 
 
 
 
 Though the specifics are a little vague, this student has proposed three ideas and has touched on the details and motivations for them."
"My ideas involve 3D animation, and this student's ideas involve filmmaking, humanitarian organization, and music making.
 
 
 
 So a joint project might could take many forms. Humanitarian concerns can be (and are commonly) addressed in both film and music, and animation can go with both. Maybe it is an animated short film (or at least partially animated), or maybe it is an animated music video to a song or series of songs."
The student wrote vaguely about their own motivations and didn't really provide any ideas for a project.
There aren't any proposed ideas to go off of to make into a project
"1) Vague notion of video editing
 
 2) vague notion of humanitarian efforts
 
 3) Vague notion of creating music.
 
 
 
 Basically, it's pretty vague."
Maybe something with iterative video? Take video of people wanting previous participants and do some sort of synthesis using the similarities (or differences).
"Idea 1: an interaction based installation that incorporates data from different devices, or robotic display.
 
 Idea 2: work to develop cheaper hardware to benefit future designers and problem-solvers.
 
 Idea 3: A screen made up of a grid of independent, hanging LEDs that move to emulate the reflection on the water in a glass in response to a participant disturbing it."
"My ideas involve animation, and this student's ideas involve a robotic screen that reacts to participants' interactions.
 
 
 
 So a joint project might take the form of an installation that incorporates animations expressed in physical 3D on a robotic screen and viewer interaction."
"To be honest, pretty sure I'm not on this person's level, neither thinking, or actual like tinkering. Obviously you could blend the first and the third projects because you mention an installation, lights, and robotics. I'm not sure how interactive the third idea is, but maybe instead of a camera looking at the hanging LEDs from below, it can look at it from above and have people walk under the lights? This way like if someone is walking and the lights are hanging too low, you can move them up with the pulley system you were mentioning. And use a Kinect to measure distance."
"First idea is to develop an interactive light show or system.
 
 The second idea is to find ways to make things that are expensive and time consuming to do now, cheaper and more efficient.
 
 The third idea is to okay with light, water, and perception."
Together we could create some kind of interaction between a physical and digital system.
"Yes, I think they though deeply about what they could and would do."
There is great expanse on ideas and passions in this idea run. The first idea is to use MAX/MSP to create a sound to light interactive system. The second idea is to create a theatre company that can reproduce the quality of theater performances here in america in countries without significant funding for musicals and theatre performances. The third idea is to create new content for a musical play.
I have created musical compositions for musicals in the past and I would love to be a part of a team to create new content for musicals. It would also be a privilege to find a way to create a good quality theatre performances in other countries.
"The person has given thought to it, but doesnt describe the ideas quite enough.
 
 The first idea is to create a graphic novel.
 
 The second idea is to create a cartoon from the characters he/she has already created.
 
 The third idea is is to ultimately create a graphic novel."
"All of the ideas have to do with either graphic novels or cartoons, so why not create a connection. Make a book that has the cartoon within it. Create a book, then put a screen within it, and instead of having a regular graphic novel, the cartoon appears."
"1) Graphic novel
 
 2) full cartoon
 
 3) Webcomic leading into graphic novel.
 
 
 
 I would have liked more detail on each idea. None of these are fleshed out enough for my liking."
Well they appear to be interested in graphics and rich story line. We could certainly make a roleplaying game out of their novel.
"I think he/she seem like a visual artist, especially 3d animator or interactive media. I can imagine this interactive media system relate with human body. I think 3D animation project is so many potential energy in diverse field like he/she is interested in human psychology."
"I can imagine how his/her project would be great if these three ideas will be developed. To make a go of it, I think he/she has to collaborate with kind of artists such as media installation, sound, or performers. These project ideas are impressive for me and it would be very helpful to make human life better if you develop his/her own system in this semester."
I just have NO idea of what this person is saying.
"The first idea would be to develop a 3d character.
 
 The second idea is to develop a full length animation that is intense and far beyond a few month's capabilities.
 
 The third one is to build upon your skills as an animator and develop something you're proud of."
"We could develop some sort of animation together, as I had done a lot of animation work myself."
The student gave an honest and sincere effort and I believe gave some great answers. The student clearly proposes three ideas in their post. The first idea that the student proposes is essentially making a virtual character (which I think is really cool). The second idea was also a digital animation idea on making a very detailed video game. The last idea was about creating a digitally constructed visual.
If me and this student were assigned to collaborate for the semester I think we could make some very cool digital visuals because this student seems to be very experienced in making digital visuals and I am very artistic and creative and I think I could help this student with some great ideas for visuals that he could actually make on the computer.
Didnt go into much depth besides speaking of animation.
There are three ideas proposed with significant information for me to understand the ideas. The first idea is to create a website or game. The second idea is to create a virtual world with content that mirrors this world. I love the idea of replicating an reliving historical time periods. The third idea is to create a game with intelligent AI that can replicate a human player.
"I think that this student and I could work very well together. My background is in computers and computer programming as well, I think we could take the smaller idea as is and make it into a full blown project."
"All of your ideas seem to be based around developing some sort of game or program. It isn't that I don't find these ideas interesting, however what other projects might you be open to? For example, with your second idea: Would you take it a step further and utilize the Oculus Rift headset?"
"This student made a very sincere effort and gave some very interesting answers, the student clearly proposed three ideas. The first idea is about showcasing project mapping by using max msp. The second idea is an interactive gaming system for children in hospitals that involves a digital environment. The last idea was creating a new way of playing video games that eliminates ""screen watching""."
"I think your anti screen looking project idea is amazing, too often I have caught my younger brother committing this cardinal video game sin. The cube was a great idea, ignoring the top and bottom of the cube you have 4 surfaces and with video games often offering 4 player co-op you can projection map on each of the sides. you can make the cube sort of a furniture piece, coming with chairs (maybe cubes as well), and a way to easily store it+its projectors. I can not help you on the lines of knowing Max, but I think you should think ahead a bit to on how you could market such an awesome device/piece of furniture. The cube look could work as a ""futuristic"" vibe and that alone could be enough to get people interested. You could also make it so that it could be installed in arcades or bars allowing people to play games with friends or strangers."
"My way-far-out-you-are-insane addition: let's make a completely projected room from the outside-in, possibly using something like four white cloth sheets and project a 3D space from outside and possibly add some sort of motion tracking mechanism with objects or the people.
 
 
 
 My bound-to-earth proposal: yeah, let's do that."
"This is the most well thought out and fully realized pitches for an idea I've read so far. The carving of a wolf sounds like a lot of fun, but also a lot of work. The space installation sounds fascinating, especially the concepts being conveyed by the piece."
The idea about creating the frame sounds very unique. I would like to see something like that.
"I'm not really sure how I could tie these together honestly. The ideas are very different, but maybe I'm just not thinking outside the box enough. However, I am thinking that maybe you could just smash all the ideas together, creating the installation with the sculpture instead of the light and it allows people to feel what others are feeling. I'm not really sure though."
"This person shows really fun ideas that may or may not be simple but are interesting to see. The ideas are quite clear with specific features. 
 
 
 
 Their three ideas are simultaneous video game plays, virtual reality device that allows changes in the user's past, and an interactive display with a projection mapping of a mermaid."
"I think these are some interesting ideas but they are a little over my head.
 
 The first is for some Pokemon game but I'm not too familiar with Pokemon games but i like the idea of projecting older games onto surfaces to give them a new feel.
 
 The second idea is for a alternate timeline which sounds cool but I'm confused how it would be executed.
 
 The last is for an interactive mermaid projection which seems to react to sound and motion."
"As a game developer and programmer, I would be able to work with this student to create a game, given their lack of experience in programming. However, 'create a game' is incredibly broad, as games vary greatly based on their genre and theme, so it's difficult to lay out what type of game we would make; I would need to know more about this student's interests and what their goal is for the game."
"You'd like to make a stand to reduce the clutter of electronics. The problem with it is that there is stuff already kind of like that, and organizers already made. If you do make it so that its all contained with in the nightstand it could be really neat and even marketable. 
 
 
 
 For your second idea I think solar energy would be your best bet because I'm not sure of how you could take energy from the body and transfer it into a battery. With this idea, any article of clothing could be used for quick energy which would be pretty neat. The big problem I see is the lack of comfort from the clothing that you might get with attaching batteries and other things. People probably won't want to wear it if it's uncomfortable, especially if its hot. 
 
 
 
 The third Idea seems to be thought out, but I'm not sure what your concept is for the game. If you're good with animation you might be able to make a trailer that would spark interest for programmers. I think the biggest part before moving onto working with the occulus rift is to find that group to make your trailer and create a small part of the game."
"The student made a very good effort on his/her thoughts. All three ideas were detailed and gave the reader a good ideas as to what the student would want accomplished, and possible tools that would be used in order to accomplish their goals.
 
 
 
 Reiteration of ideas:
 
 Idea 1 - Creating a model of a stand to hold all of his electronic devices and chargers by his bed to watch from.
 
 
 
 Idea 2 - Creating wearable technology that is attached to the clothing that gathers solar, body heat, and kinetic energy, as a source of energy that could be stored into a battery.
 
 
 
 Idea 3 - Creating a virtual reality game for the oculus rift, likely a first person shooter, that also uses a suit, fans, and other devices to simulate a more realistic experience."
I think part of his third idea would likely be a good choice for a semester/year long project. A group of people would definitely be able to create a virtual world using Unity to create a simple first person shooter. This project could possibly be taken even further depending on the time and try to incorporate the coding needed to make this game usable with the Oculus Rift.
"The student could use more time to get more specific with the ideas.
 
 The first just states what they would work with not exactly what they would make.
 
 The second is for a system that automatically tended to a garden, I was wondering how this would be done.
 
 The last is for an interactive sculpture which seems interesting."
"The ideas here aren't too fleshed out, but you've already begun to think about what things you would want in order to make something. Consider finding the limits of the technology, and go down from there."
"I really like the arduino planting idea. I'm not really sure what I add at this point, but the idea is interesting and could really find a use in different businesses around the world."
There are only two kind of vague ideas presented here. The first is a garden that would take care of itself utilizing an Arduino to do the physical work. The second is an interactive sculpture of some sort with no other details.
"Your idea is very deeply thought out. Religion is an important aspect in an individual's life and it can help one out through college experience. I know the feeling of being wanting to fit into a group or service that you are interested and passion about. Your project seems very interesting, not everyone will agree to religion but they will agree to a community build upon passion"
This person made a sincere effort to express their ideas. This persons ideas were about creating clubs and organizations to help teach respect and other important things to our ASU students. These are some awesome ideas but I would try and leave religion out of it.
I am not at all that religious but I would do my best to help set up these clubs and organizations. If they need an app or something I could help out and mix my idea into it but other than that I just don't see us collaborating.
"The ideas of a physical object that can be projected on with animations that can cater to the shape, a cloth or outfit that can be tracked and projected onto for plays and musicals, and a Immersive animation sequence that give the persona sense of being in the POV of the character. You did give this sincere effort and I do like the three of your ideas. I actually love the idea of the clothing that can be tracked and projected onto. It sounds extremely difficult but since your given a billion dollars I'm sure you can accomplish it."
With these three ideas I believe that me and this student could work on some cool mapping project that uses the artistic aspects the student spoke of in the third idea to make a really cool visual experience for the viewers.
"Idea number one doesn't seem like much of an idea. It seems like this student is saying they would just spend the week brainstorming. Ideas 2 & 3 both have to do with getting clean water to those around the world who need it most. They also seem like the same idea, just in different words."
I very much enjoy the idea of the rain water collecting building. We take for granted of the water supply we get in America even though some part of the country is hurting from trouts and lack of water. For an idea that gather rain water for usage is a pretty good idea. The facility can be build in an area that is rich with rain during certain time of the year like Florida or Washington. If you can collect the water then filter and a way to distribute it it would be really helpful.
Yes this student made a sincere effort to explain their ideas. One of their projects was about scanning magic cards and projecting some type of holographic image. The other was to make a portfolio of all the work they have completed and also a short animation film.
"This student has some great ideas, especially the studio idea. I would use my skills in web-development and programming to help out in any way I could to get a studio going."
"I really like the Magic idea, at the moment the streams of Magic Invitationals are rather boring but adding in the spectacle of the 3D rendering could really ramp up the entertainment."
"Three things were pretty clearly proposed. The stop-motion idea is intriguing, as is the holograph-magic card idea (even if it's a little derivative of the yugi-oh anime). And the portfolio development sounds like a really awesome idea."
"I'd love to collaborate on any of these projects, Doing concept sketches of possible characters for the magic cards, or helping to sculpt creatures for the stop-motion animation sound awesome. spending a semester working with other artists and collaborating on creating our individual portfolios and having that input from other artists sounds so beneficial."
"I like the idea of creating an interface that would create 3D prints of magic cards. Ever since I was little when I use to collect pokemon cards and yugioh cards, I always thought it would be amazing if they had something that I could scan my cards with and that would put them into a game or something. To this day they don't really have anything like that as far as for card games. I know they have Skylanders which sort of does the same thing but for action figures."
"There is a lot of excess verbiage; it sounds like an ad for Pottermore. Your description needs to show more objectiveness, like someone just talking about it not someone excitedly looking forward to it."
"This entry is direct and to the point meeting the need of immediate satisfaction that this world now craves.
 
 It meets the challenge by explaining the site in a clear fashion without emotion yet allows the excitement of the fan world to glimpse through the basic unemotional descriptions."
"Is Pottermore a game or does it interact with the books? In your description, it almost sounds like a game based on a book, and I am not sure that fits the criteria."
"Interesting choice of future book. The strengths of your entry are in the wide variety of uses for blogs as well as examples for them. You have done a lot of research, and it shows. 
 
 The blog meets the challenge of future book by being a never ending, ever-evolving work of text contributed to by many."
"You have a lot of examples in your entry. If you remove those and just show a variety of blogs types, styles and topics and maybe a blog 101 that would work better."
Wow! Those are quite the concepts for reading in the future. You have listed a variety and their uses today and in the time to come.
"I do not think the history of writing or the technology based readers is needed nor are the steps technology has made in computers. They make no difference to the system you are discussing. 
 
 I think if you keep your description to factual based reporting of the systems it will work better in the guide."
I wonder if Reddit has everything like you state. How is the information validated? Are there actual books there or is it just blogs and just used for information look up? Your guide is slightly confusing to me if you could clarify I would appreciate it.
"Anything Star Wars is an automatic win in my book, and I'm all for retro feels. The physical description of the book and its contents is clear, and taking the reader through the steps of how the images change is helpful to understand what makes this book special."
"Describing the lenticular printing process earlier in the summary might be helpful to the reader, allowing us to get a better mental image of what is being described without resorting Google to get a quick and dirty definition."
Fantastic description of the capabilities and (likely endless) possibilities of tumblr. Thorough representation of how you feel tumblr is changing the face of books/lit related media and the features available to bloggers.
"Excellent description of the features, functionality, and purpose of Pottermore website. I had heard of it before, but always considered it to be a stagnant wiki for the Potter 'verse. It was enlightening to know that Rowling continues to participate. I think your description of how this is part of the future of books was laid out well using this specific example."
"Repetition of ""lore"" in the summary. Consider using synonyms in the other places this word was used? Extra word in first sentence of section 3: ""While Pottermore is limited to <b>to</b> Harry Potter"". Awkward phrasing: ""or eventual silver screen"". Consider revising wording and encasing this section in parenthetical?"
"Excellent fact backup and mini-history of audio-blogging/podcasting. Section 3 is well thought out and highlights the pitfalls of a physical printing process, while underscoring the viability of podcasts as a literary medium. Bonus points for the use of ""bourgeois""."
"Consider adding html links to research citations and the 99% Invisible podcast. This line confused me: ""Pew Research reports that in the past 30 years the levels of individuals over the age of 18 who do not has doubled."" What are these people not doing? Consider revising wording to make this reference clear."
Completed assignment on time.
"I encountered several run-on sentences throughout the assignment. This made it difficult to follow the author's arguments. Consider revising and parsing arguments out into a more centralized format. Additionally, incorrect word usage (""is becoming more patience"", ""provides the reader to"", ""as oppose to a book"", etc) made it extremely difficult to assimilate the author's meaning."
"What a great example! I had no idea what to write about in my description and think that you chose the perfect media. You've provided a ton of information in your 300 word allotted space. There definitely isn't much ""fluff""- you get down to business from the start. I wish I had a better grasp of what this technology is, as I then think that this would be an extremely informative explanation. Your knowledgable of this type of media is apparent in your description and I learned something new by reading your assignment. 
 
 
 
 You seem confident in your prediction of the future of the book and readers of your assignment cannot deny the contagiousness of your excitement."
"Having no idea what an ""augmented reality reading experience"" is, your summary only confused me! Maybe somehow include in that initial summary that this product's purpose is to deliver a 3D reading and viewing experience. That is the point of this technology, correct?
 
 
 
 Also, the following sentence is confusing: ""At this time, it is an iPhone or iPad but there is an Android version under development."" I ran into many of these ""for instances"" and kept having to reread sections of your assignment. It was choppy to me and a hard read. There are numerous run on sentences and a plethora of facts but not enough explanation.Perhaps my best advice to you, as someone who has never heard of such a technology, is to reread your assignment and pretend you're in my shoes.
 
 
 
 Good luck!"
"Your summary is great - straightforward and provides the necessary information to understand your idea of the future of books. You chose a very interesting subject matter and I'm excited to check out www.postsecret.com in my free time.
 
 
 
 Your 300 word description is extremely clear and easy to follow. The time that you spent working on this assignment is apparent. You gave a great description of the book itself and allowed your readers to have a grasp of your personal experience with the book and how it changed the way you 
 
 
 
 My favorite line of your description is the following: ""The book is colorful and dark, emotional and boring, fantastic and dull.""
 
 
 
 I love the following line as well: ""What makes this book afuture book is that it doesnt have a single author. It is more like an interactive blog or news feed on an internet social media sight than an actual book."" I wouldn't have linked this book with the ever-popular social media world, but your point is great and so true.
 
 
 
 Overall, I don't think that your assignment needs much revising. You did a great job with the rough draft and looks more like a final draft to me than a rough draft!
 
 
 
 I look forward to reading and critiquing your future assignments for this course!"
"You gave a great summary of the work that you chose to be the future of books. Your quick snippet of a description is clear and purposeful. Your readers have a great grasp on what they are about to read in your description.
 
 
 
 I love that you included a link in your description and have every intention on visiting the website in my free time to learn more about ""Click-Clack the Rattlebag"".
 
 
 
 My favorite sentences of your assignment were the following:'Click-Clack the Rattlebag is a book in name only. Its text is entirely invisible, you see: invisible like ghosts. And thus, aesthetically,Click-Clack is a work of art presented entirely in vocal narrative."" As a reader, you definitely got me interested in the media that you chose to explore and the eerie ""Click-Clack the Rattlebag""."
"Wow! I absolutely love that you included a picture with your summary. It made your assignment come alive and was obviously the first thing that I noticed when I clicked on the title of your work. Not only did you include a picture, but it's a very interesting picture! Just by reading your summary, I got super curious as to what experiencing ""touch"" would be like on pottermore.com. I didn't know such a website existed about the Harry Potter series but am not surprised! I only read a couple of the Harry Potter books (I've never been much into fiction) but am curious and excited to explore the website. It's great that you included the link within your writing.
 
 
 
 Your excitement of this media is apparent in your writing, and definitely string along your readers to read through your whole assignment. I love how you mentioned that the pottermore.com crashed during it's initial release, that you insist that this website is just ""that cool.""
 
 
 
 I love that you realized the following: ""While it is not a replacement for the tome-like books, it brings a flair that is impossible to experience with paper alone."" (My assignment is based on this idea as well.)
 
 
 
 I think my favorite line of your assignment was the following: ""If this website could be neatly bound, pressed, and fitted with a dust jacket, it might be the most perfect book of the future."" You realize that even though the website is super cool, there is still a need for tangible bound books. I agree!"
"UNFORTUNATELY, I don't think that your assignment needs much revision. You did an excellent job of ""doing it right the first time"" and it is obvious that your sentences are thoughtful and calculated.
 
 
 
 If anything, maybe include the pottermore.com link in your summary?
 
 
 
 Great work. I'm looking forward to reading and ""critiquing"" your future assignments for this class!"
"I had a hard time finding the strengths of your assignment, as I don't think that you followed the assignment prompt. After reading and rereading your writing, I'm not clear as to what you think the future book will look like. I understand that you've done some family history research and plan on passing it down to your children and your children's children via digital photography and writing, though I have no idea about what you think the future of books will be.
 
 
 
 Please see my constructive criticism below, as I think that your rough draft needs some major rewriting."
"Your summary isn't very clear. My first suggestion would be to rewrite this portion of the assignment and be straightforward, not leaving anything to be guessed or assumed. The purpose of a summary is to tell the reader exactly what they are about to read, not to leave them wondering what your subject matter is and what they're about to get involved with.
 
 
 
 Of the five assignments I've read, yours needs the most amount of revision in my opinion. I'm not exactly sure how to approach your writing, as I kind of think the whole thing needs to be rewritten. The assignment was to decide on what the future of the book will be and give a 300 word explanation of it, followed by why you think that society is leaning in the direction of your chosen mode of literary media. To me, your assignment just seems to tell of how you've done some research on your family history. Perhaps you should read through the assignment prompt again, as I think that you may have been confused as to what we were supposed to write about. Maybe I'm so wrong and I've completed the assignment incorrectly, but mine follows the same guidelines as the other four I've just critiqued.
 
 
 
 I hope you don't find my response as rude, would just rather tell it to you straight as you have an opportunity to fix your assignment before you turn in the final draft - that's a good thing!"
"The entry specifically points to the book's uniqueness, in that it is not necessarily just an e-book or a website; it is her brand. This meets the assignment's challenge by being both specific and creative by finding a book that is very atypical."
"This entry did not find a specific book, but instead wrote about a hypothetical one. The main challenge is to think of books creatively, but this does not pinpoint something that I can actually go out and see for myself. I would suggest trying to find a hybrid-type book, or at least something that could become hybrid very easily."
"This is highly imaginative and definitely something that would be a fun, interactive experience for any reader. It meets the challenge by turning a book into a video game, something that is surely being worked on by the creators of e-books and web-books."
"By not giving a real example of such a book, this entry is not completed. While the exact book the author speaks of may not yet exist, an example should still be found, per the assignment. The author should find something that is similar so that I can at least see what they're talking about a little more clearly."
"Using a PostSecret book is a great choice. It is compiled of thousands of people's work, making it a unique, collaborative project (that, somehow, still keeps its secrets). The explanation of the future factor is spot on: it is a blog in a book, and surely a medium that will evolve into something great."
"Perhaps in the future factor section, the author could make a solid case for why exactly I should go out and buy it. While obviously I'm interested, what specifically makes this book extra appealing, and why?"
"The book promoted truly does break down barriers of storytelling, as the author states. It is a wonderful example of the future book, and giving many examples of its strengths makes the entry very convincing. Additionally, the author's telling is both engaging and compelling."
"Perhaps add more written examples in the middle section, creating an overall convincing entry."
"I really like how you pointed out, in the beginning of your explanation, that you do not think books will ever die. I think this is important because, it keeps in mind that yes, although documentary film is becoming an extremely popular way for information to be transferred, it is not going to replace the traditional method of exchanging information. It also allows for books to remain special and sacred, and to stay an outlet for those who want to ˜disappear into their own world. This being said, you make an excellent point in stating that film is very relatable as it is easy to SEE another individual, and thus experience aspects of their lives with them. I also think you did a very good job explaining the film and in explaining the intrigue and the value in its genre as a documentary."
"I agree with you that sites such as tumblr are growing to be exponentially popular. In addition to liking and reblogging photos, users can reblog and critique or praise an individual's work, which includes but is not limited to: art,photography, music, poetry, and short stories. Because there is potential for re-blogging content, if an individual posts exceptional work, their work is likely to become extremely popular on the site, which can be a very good thing for the original poster. I think that many people who use tumblr use the site for the exact purpose of discovering and connecting to other people's posts, opinions, and self-created work."
"I think you did an excellent job of building up this book. You made the book seem very intriguing, exciting, and above all, futuristic. I have no idea how you managed to include pictures, but the pictures certainly did an amazing job of enhancing the work and proving your overall point. Through viewing the photos alone, and without reading any of your text, I got the feel that this book is incredibly different than other 'traditional' books, and in this I think you absolutely met the challenge of this assignment. I think that, in your final draft, your photos will do an outstanding job at proving your point. In addition to this, your writing was well-thought out, properly organized, and succeeded in dynamically building up the book you chose. Great work!"
"I honestly do not believe you need to embellish upon your original draft before it is finalized; your work was clear, concise, and to the point, as well as implanting an interest and an intrigue in not only the work you described, but also in a genre of books that follows the style of your chosen work. I wouldn't change anything to this draft, so good job!"
"I do agree that websites such as Reddit are not only very popular now, but will also continue to be popular in the future. People want a way to interact with one another, and also want to find individuals who share certain interests. As you said, it is not just text that is used on Reddit, but also pictures. In addition, people can also bring in other information to help others out or to just share interesting experiences, and I think that people of todays generations and in future generations really enjoy that autonomy in writing and reading."
"I believe that this description of the Role-Playing book was sufficient in answering the prompt questions. In addition, the OP made the Role Playing book seem exciting, challenging, and subjective to one's decisions and preferences, which many individuals will most certainly enjoy. The book is also not limited, it seems, to a physical, hand-held book, and can also be read and 'played' on e-devices, making it accessible from many different locations and in many different ways. The reader will be in control of the outcome of the ending, which can be a delightful experience for many individuals who prefer this type of book."
"I believe that the author should make sure to be more clear about the fact that you can use this book in more ways than just reading through pages. Although e-devices were mentioned, I was still confused as to whether or not this type of book would be hand-held, on an e-device, or both. How will the book be accessed on an e-device - from a website? Will it be purchased and downloaded instantaneously, or ordered? Will it have any software that must be installed onto an e-device? While the author said that this book would be available for e-devices, I feel it should be more explicitly stated that it can fluctuate between being an experience through page or through screen, both, or neither, because I am still unsure as to whether this book can be read in the way a traditional book is read, or if that is not the case at all. Other than this, this genre of future books sounds exciting!"
"The article is well-written and accurately describes the subject matter and how it can be seen in the future of the book, particularly in the realm of fan-author interactions."
"The article is very well written and gives the reader a good understanding of the nature of the Pottermore website. Adding the detail about the site crashing on launch is also a great way to show that it's not just the author who feels positive about this sort of continuation of printed works in the digital realm, as is comparing it to other popular social media."
"The image provided doesn't seem to reflect the interactive nature of the website. Perhaps a screenshot of one of the activities described in the ""Description"" would be better?"
"The author does an excellent job of both describing the material, making it sound almost irresistible to readers, and explaining why this book exemplifies how technology will shape the future of the book. Providing the link to the material in question is also quite nice."
"It's a bit nitpicky, but ""I have selected"" is hardly necessary here. It would far more effectively to cut that out and stick with the basic summary of the work."
"The article is very well-rounded and addresses many valid points about blogs and how they reflect the changing nature of writing online, publishing online, and the closer interactions between reader and writer."
"""Annarasumanara"" is a Korean variation on the many Japanese web-based, comic-book style stories that grew out of the Manga and Anime and comics of a few decades ago and that have now become rendered as graphically enhanced software that can be displayed on computer screens. The strength of this entry is that it does demonstrate an important aspect of the continuing evolution of books by showing us an example of one segment of the ""reading pool"" that is now making the transition from print to digital format."
"This is quite an interesting interpretation of the intent of this assignment. Using DNA testing as a way to build a historical thread that can possibly reveal long-lost relatives from the past, or perhaps uncover historical facts about people that might help to strengthen filial bonds (or not!) certainly identifies an application of a current technology (genetic and genome analysis) that can be used in a very positive way. And the translation of the data collected into electronic formats will make it more likely that information converted from printed and pictorial media will be stored in a centralized place, with a reasonably high chance surviving for a very long time. You seem to be agreeing, then, that the eventual transformation of knowledge and information, including books, from the printed formats of today to more digitized forms is not only occurring, but will continue to happen until one day nearly all of our reading interactions will take place through a human-machine, electronic interface."
"This is a very good example of a current technology that is moving us closer to a time when written information is created, edited, refined, developed, critiqued, and stored in an Internet-based, 'cloud-like' environment. In a direction divergent from social-networking websites such as Facebook -- and as the author of this entry has explained -- Tumblr demonstrates one of the ways in which our book and information technology is changing from one based on printed materials to one based in a digital universe. Human interactions here are and will rely on man-machine interfaces that may eventually eliminate the need for printed copies of nearly everything. This example also welcomes wild speculation about the way humans will be exchanging information in the future!"
"Since a good example has been found that demonstrates a current trend in the timeline of 'book technology' (past, present, and future), In working toward a final draft, the author should not forget to provide a back drop to Tumblr, perhaps by describing more about what lead to Yahoo's acquisition of this technology, provide some more details about Tumbler itself (images, descriptions), and to speculate on where this technology could be leading us and how it will impact the continuing evolution of the book. References to course readings would also be a plus, if applicable."
"Kali's selection of ""Night Film"" for her entry for the field guide is presented very well and the embedded images provide visuals that help the reader understand the unusual characteristics of this book. Although scores of other authors have incorporated illustrations, graphs, images, codes, and other visual devices to enhance the reader's experience in 'living' the story, the merging of information that provides the reader with links and other interfaces to the Internet, the importance this additional information has to the story lines and the need to download an external decoder, while possibly annoying to some readers, is in itself an example of how the current technology of the book is using the wonders of the digital age in incorporating some of its interfaces as an integral part of the book."
"This is another good example of a book that uses current digital technology to enhance a reader's interactive experience (in this case, a children's book designed to be read on an iPad using iBooks as the e-reading application. Although printed books have provided an excellent medium to display vivid illustrations and bright colors for children, it is not until books began to be digitized and designed to be read on electronic reading devices that animations, voices, and movement -- all of which greatly enhance a child's interaction with a story -- that features such as the author has described are now possible. Selecting a children's book in demonstrating possible directions for the future of books provides ample room to speculate on what may be in the realm of possibility within the next decade and, indeed, within the next century."
"As mentioned in other critiques, and as this idea continues to be refined, some thought should be spent on the possibility of describing the history of book technology and in providing suggestions for where our digital reading technology is taking us. To be sure, printed books have been a critical factor in the advancement of mankind, but I think it would be nice to read more about some of the differences between what some of us may have experienced as children and what amazing options are for the children of today. Extend this into the future, and the possibilities become quite exciting indeed!"
"The field guide attempts to show the ability that technology has to instantly document our lives and save that documentation forever, without fear of it being lost due to some physical destruction. The problem is we spend most of the field guide learning about the authors time his/her brother uploaded their DNA online in order to map back potential members of their gene pool. While this is interesting it seems to fall short of the assigned task of finding a (a real book, object, publication, real or virtual thing), not something made up."
The field guide closely follows the prompt and finds a new type of way to engage with books through some sort of future or new technology. The guide explains the process of emerging existing texts into a more immersive reality and has made me want to download the app on mu iPhone.
"In the future factor section, the field guide slips away from the pragmatic approach taken in the description and delves into an area of more idealizing than explaining this thing in the desired technical manner."
"Kudos for using futuristic implementations into the field guide, like the hyperlink to News from Gardenia's Unbound site and the picture. The Field Guide does well to sell its audience on News from Gardenia which is a book about the possibility of a utopian future. The author of the guide accurately and with concise but important detail, gives an accurate description of the thing they are writing on."
"Though Unbound, the crowdsourcing platform for book publishing is really the futuristic aspect of the guide we only hear about it once we get to the last section. Instead of describing News from Gardenia so thoroughly we should be getting a description of how Unbound will change the future of text."
The field guide describes Reddit very well and points out all the aspects of Reddit that make it something that answers the prompt's questions. The field guide creates even for someone who knows nothing about Reddit a well thought out description enabling them to use the site.
The selected thing from which the Field Guide is created follows the prompt perfectly. The description in the field guide explains what has changed in the books adaptation and these changes are a result in new technologies and advancements made.
I would really think of new ways in which ebooks can change like the way the one described in the field guide did. Instead of assuming that mainly a transition from paper to electronic format is all that will happen. Fill your future factor section with more of what you think is a possibility of the ebook.
"The technologies described definitely seem to provide a more immersive experience for the reader. Especially ""Alice,"" with its ability to provide a previously unheard of level of interactivity with the story itself. The selections point toward an emerging technology meant to work with the existing book itself to make it something new. It meets the challenges of the assignment by detailing how these products enhance the reading experience in a variety of ways (social, interactive, and reviews). It also hints toward how these technologies might be expanded upon in the future, to further change the reading experience."
"This entry very effectively describes the ergodic text, ""House of Leaves,"" and how it utilizes unorthodox methods of story-telling to give voice to several characters. The features detailed make the prospect of reading a text of such innovative design very enticing. It is representative of how certain authors are now bushing the limitations of the traditional book to tell stories in a way few could have previously imagined."
"This sounds like an amazing companion to one of the, if not the, most popular book series' in history. The Harry Potter series enjoyed immense popularity before it ever graced a movie screen. There are few modern series' that have managed to hold the public attention in such large numbers for seven books and eight film adaptations. I can only imagine how immersive and how much fun this site would be for a Harry Potter fan. I think this description really gives the reader a sense of the level of content on the site. As well as several examples of the interesting and creative content they can expect to find when they visit it. For an fan, after reading that description, I can only imagine that their next stop would be Pottermore.com."
"It is not made clear in the description if this resource can be used by someone reading the book for added effect to their reading experience or if it is simply intended that more condensed and interactive ebooks/websites will eventually replace books. I do not agree with the comment about ""the perfect book for the Twitter generation"". Such books and short versions of full-length texts already exist. An old example would be the novelization of the death of Superman and his eventual return. Roger Stern was tasked with novelizing the most popular comic book story arc in the history of the medium, titled ""The Death and Life of Superman"". It was so popular that DC Comics produced a more condensed novelization for younger readers, titled ""Superman: Doomsday and Beyond"" by Louise Simonson. Generally, readers go to books for a greater depth of information and storytelling, which they find immersive. It is usually film adaptations that go the more condensed route. I don't se how such an innovation could actually replace the modern book, until they provide the same level of information and storytelling, as well a similar practicality of use."
"Fair warning: This is my second review about this site. I feel this description did a very good job of highlighting the social features of the site and the additional literary content, in the form of fan fiction and the small additions from Rowling, which would definitely be a draw for any die hard Harry Potter fan. Combined with the continual development of additional story content in the games and the ability to stay in contact with J.K. Rowling herself. It definitely appears that Pottermore.com would be the number one place to go to immerse one's self in the Harry Potter universe."
"There is no clear connection to the idea that this is an evolution of the book, or something bound to replace the book. It is a website. A very in-depth site with many features, but it is still not a place where on can go and read the seven official Harry Potter texts or an innovation that delivers those stories in another way but in the same depth. It is a great resource for fans, but it is still reliant on the existence of the books, in basically their traditional form, one which to build this universe."
I believe you've made a strong point here about the similarity between documentary and informational text. There is a natural connection in the way that the information is delivered. Video in a how-to or documentary style may very well replace their textbook or informational text counterparts in the future. This is one of the few types of books I believe is on the way out.
"I think the author of this entry effectively argued their point I do not have any criticism, other than that the ""future factor"" section was definitely over 150 characters."
"This entry goes in depth to explore how podcasts offer the same experience of reading a book but with the added benefit of being able to multi-task. It effectively explains what a podcast is, who uses them, and why they are important. It also uses several very specific examples to strengthen its assertions."
"The only suggestion I would have is to make mention of the millions of different types of podcasts are out there. There is truly a podcast for everybody. This would give readers a reason to seek out podcasts. I know a lot of people who are intimidated by them just because they don't understand what they are, or that there are podcasts out there that cater to their interests."
"This is an extremely well-written entry, with enough excellent description to make anybody want to read (or here, listen to) this story. It highlights a very relevant piece, one which blends the custom of stories with the ""second orality"" we are focusing on. The writer of this entry appeals to ""the illiterate and the bibliobibuli alike,"" stating the advantages of such a form of literature in the modern world. A great entry!"
"I've read and reread this entry trying to find something to suggest an improvement on, and I can't find it. This is a great entry and I think it accomplished everything it was meant to."
This is a very interesting take on the future of the book -- the focus on an interactive future is exciting. I think this entry presents an excellent argument for the futuristic digitalization of literature. It effectively describes the benefits of such technology and why it is an important option for our literary future.
"I think this entry could spend a little less time describing less relevant things (i.e., the first paragraph of the second section) and focus instead on simply and succinctly describing some of the features of Ideo. It would be interesting to have a quick summary of the features offered by the Nelson, Coupland, and Alice concepts. This would allow for further exploration of the specific benefits of each feature as they relate to different potential readers."
"This entry wonderfully blends the arts of printed books and digital media, must like the subject itself. It is clear that the writer supports the idea of digital media as an enhancer of printed text, rather than a complete replacement, which is something I completely relate to. This entry effectively describes the content of the story without being over-revealing, and it describes the ways in which the story is a glimpse into the future of literature."
I think this entry does a great job of answering each of the questions and meeting the requirements of the assignment. I am absolutely inspired as a reader to experience this work for myself.
"I think this entry very effectively describes what makes ""Annarasumanara"" different from other e-texts, and therefore a ""future"" book rather than one we already know. The author picks out a specific characteristic of this web comic (the noticeably different format and disregard to the uniformity consistent with other web comics) to distinguish it from others and propose it as a futuristic text. It also gives readers an idea of what the web comic is about, and makes us curious to know more about the characters and story line."
"Great choice of film! I love the documentary Babies, and I think you hit upon its main unique strength here in a very eloquent way. Rather than use text at all to communicate its message, it relies specifically on non-verbal cues and images throughout the film. I really like how you mention that if you glance away for a moment, you can miss a part of the story, as that is very true for that film and for so many social cues which are non-verbal. I think this brings up all sorts of great questions, because if this film is a sort of future book it seems more a type of oral culture than literary culture. Indeed, it would seem that almost all documentary films are, in a way, more a throwback to an oral culture than literary culture. I think you've hit on an interesting idea here."
"Wow, this is definitely a double-future dose. Literally future-esque, as in its subject matter, and then the figuratively future-esque of the assignment, with the Unbound Publishing. I'm a big reader and I hadn't heard of Unbound, so very cool!
 
 
 
 I love your description of the book, as you point out right away what makes the subject matter of the book unique--the isn't the same old dystopian novel, but a utopian novel where we aren't all subject to the same old gloom and doom. You point out the book's effects, that it has the ability to inspire people to make a better world, which I think is also important to make people want to run out and grab it. They know what its about, but what is it going to make them feel? So in several ways, you've found a very unique book. 
 
 
 
 I also appreciate that you are concise. In English classes I think we tend towards fancy language without saying a lot, and I think you use direct language here which conveys your message with the clarity the assignment wanted, something I know I had a hard time doing myself."
"I love your concept of the role playing book, and I do agree that this is already happen to an extent. I think it would help if you gave a specific book that this is already happening with, as I believe this was the assignment. 
 
 
 
 So here is where I know this is happening. James Frey's new book, I believe it is called EndGame, will include a mystery with hidden gold (?) I think and an app produced by Google, so people can solve the mystery, plan on the app, and solve the game. Here is a link: http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/comic-con-james-frey-introduce-719685
 
 
 
 Google Niantic labs makes Ingress, an interactive real world game which people have written many books about, where you are battling in the real world for I think access to power points or something?"
"I think you need to pick a single specific book or other media source in existence today (game, choose your own adventure book) and describe that. I'm sure there is something out there that fits your description.
 
 
 
 You mention Phantasy Star in your summary, so if you choose to focus on that, I think your title should explain Phantasy Star, your description should explain Phantasy Star, etc.
 
 
 
 I gave examples of the Role Playing Book above that I could think of off the top of my head but the book that has always reminded me of a Choose Your Own Adventure Novel is Italo Calvino's If on a winter's nite a traveler... so you may also want to check that one out? You don't choose your own path in it, but you, as the reader, are written into the book.
 
 
 
 Also, I think you could compare Choose Your Own Adventure Novels to hyperlinks on the internet. Really, when we browse the internet, we are choosing our own adventure with each click. Instead of flipping to a different page in the book, we are moving to a different web page online. But until you focus on a single item, I don't think this assignment is done correctly."
"Some of the other concepts presented are awesome and future-esque, but this is by far the most intensely future-esque concept presented! Very cool. I'm surprised I haven't heard about this more, as it sounds so revelatory.
 
 
 
 I think each of these concepts sounds so complicated, it might be easier to focus on just Alice at it was the one that caught your attention."
"I was so interested in this that I looked it up online, and it looks like you took some of your info and text ""The team looked at how digital and analog books currently are being read, shared and collected, as well as at trends, business models and consumer behavior within related fields."" straight from their website? Bummer. It is important not to do this, as you will for sure get in trouble for it. If you have any other cut/copied text in there, get it out of there because Prof. Finn said he would run this through plagiarism software and it will catch this.
 
 
 
 What you want to try to do is read the web page, think about the information and process it, but say it in a completely different way. Or if you still want to say it in exactly that way, you need to attribute it to the web page.
 
 
 
 I think this is a lot to write about, as it sounds sort of overwhelming and complicated as three different book-related technologies. To me, it would be more digestible to just approach it from Alice, since you said that was the more interesting one. That way, there may be less pressure to summarize so much of what the company is doing, and it might be easier to just explain the technology of Alice itself?"
"Wow, the technologies I've critiqued thus far are crazy. I had no idea the ""future"" of the book was so advanced!
 
 
 
 This is a great choice of technology to feature, as it is obviously right on the pulse of the future.
 
 
 
 I like how you mention the possibilities with children quite a bit, as I think that is important, I know many children who already use iPads as reading tools and I can definitely see this as a possibility in the future.
 
 
 
 You also managed to explain everything in an eloquent way, there weren't any grammar errors in your writing that I could find, so great job on that as you are talking about some complicated tech topics here."
"I think what I'm missing here, from the title down, is a clear and brief description of what augmented reality is or how it works. Are there glasses? What makes it different than how I use my iPhone or iPad now? The pictures become 3D when I look at my iPad? I point my iPad at a picture? Where is the picture, what do I point at the iPad, my eyes or the picture? I guess for the non-techie, that aspect lost me. Just a slower, more clear description of the process of reading in this augmented reality. I pick up my iPad, and then what happens? Is there text on the screen, or only pictures? 
 
 
 
 What are QR codes? I would leave that part out, and focus on explaining the process of reading this sort of book like you're talking to someone who only reads hardback novels, and has no idea about the tech world. Just walk them through the experience. I'm a fan of making things really simple.
 
 
 
 And for some reason your title shows up as ""Untitled 341,"" but then you have a subtitle? So I'm not sure what happened there, if that was a glitch in the system or something."
"The entry strengths are good because it explains how The secret lives of Men and Women can attract to people who want rather read from the internet. It challenges the assignment because it provides reasoning on why this would be the future book, such as how people adapt to social media and how this future book can relate to it."
"I think that the entry fell short on providing more reasoning as to why it will be a future book, and I would suggest to explain more about it."
The entry strengths are the detail explanation about the book. It meets the challenge of the assignment because it discuss and explains how this book can be a future book.
"I think that the entry falls short in the reader not understanding the reason this book can be the future book, It give the reader many explanation about but not very well convincing. I think that it needs to be more convincing as to why this can be a future cook."
The reader gets a full understanding of what is being describe to be the future book. It meets the challenge of the assignment because it is explained and gives a good knowledge about why the role playing game and choose your own adventure game can be the future book.
I think that this entry had good supporting information as to why it can be a future book. I think that the reader was convinced and maybe provide more information in proving the point of why it is the future book.
I really think this post was good because it provided the book information in details and that it was an ebook. It met the challenge of the assignment because their was enough information to convince the reader about the future book and why it could be.
"I think that the entry did not fall short and that its was well written with enough information for the reader to be convince. The only feedback would be about the font, It was not the regular font which is New Times Roman, that should be changed."
The strengths can be found in that there was a lot of good detail information to why the digital book is the future. It met the challenge of the assignment in proving reasons as to how the digital books will be the future books due to modern technology.
I think that the entry did not fall short and the reader was convinced that the digital books and society adapting to modern technology will enhance the demand to want digital books. I think maybe explain his question at the end.
"First of all, there are certainly some typographical errors that are easily corrected, such as ""individuals over the age of 18 who do not has doubled."" I assume that is meant to read ""over the age of 18 who do not READ has doubled"". 
 
 I believe that this field guide would also benefit from more focus. Rather than focus on the technology of podcasts or audioblogging, I would like to see how a specific podcast functions and demonstrates the way forward. The author does mention one work, ""99% Invisible"", but it is given as an example of the form rather than being the focus of the field guide. 
 
 This follows in the ""Future Factor"" portion of the response. Rather than focus on how the podcast points the way to the future of books, the author instead digresses on an unrelated tangent. While it's certainly interesting information, thoughts on book distribution, government censorship, etc. don't seem to have a place in this particular assignment. 
 
 I believe the primary changes that need to be made are in organization. Focus on a single work, demonstrate how the form is superior (or at least the way forward) and finally why this constitutes the future of the book."
"The author does an excellent job in summarizing the appeal of the novel itself. In addition, the way the book is created, with crowdsourced financing and increased interaction between audience and author, is a compelling way forward for future publications."
"The author does an excellent job at describing the uniqueness of the work itself, as well as the visual style of the art. The ability to alter or eliminate the restrictions of the printed page is well-explained in how the work takes advantage of the lack of limitation in electronic form."
"I'm not certain the author adequately explains the benefits of the ""lack of borders"". There is mention that ""the visual style of this story goes hand in hand with its format"" but not having read the work I'm not sure what this means, aesthetically. Likewise, ""it takes the act of reading a story and makes it almost into a film strip"" does not indicate why this is necessarily a positive development, or one that can be expanded to other works. 
 
 There is also some confusion that seems contradictory, such as ""some hosting sites have shrunk the pages down to a more ""normal"" size"", suggesting a traditional page layout, yet the author also says, ""it simply could not have been published in the old media"". A few lines clarifying this apparent contradiction would be helpful. 
 
 Overall, a focus on the effect of this borderless approach with this book, as well as ideas on how it could be beneficial in the future would be helpful."
"This field guide entry does an excellent job in explaining Tumblr and how it can be used by authors and artists to distribute their craft. It also demonstrates how this can be effective in a changing electronic landscape, incorporating both multiple forms of media and reader-response into an ongoing product."
"In this case, the author focuses on a technology, rather than a specific work. I believe that to properly fulfill the assignment, the guide should be refocused on a particular work that uses Tumblr as the medium, and use examples from that work to demonstrate how Tumblr is different from other mediums. While one author is mentioned as an example, the field guide would be stronger if it were focused on the work, rather than the technology."
"The author does an excellent job focusing on a single work and expanding on the method that work uses in order to demonstrate how this can be used for a variety of works. Each aspect of the expanded website is well-explained and clear, and it's easy to see how this is a useful tool to expand the world of the novel."
"I love the way you portrayed the ongoing relationship a blog can establish between author and reader in theFuture Factor section and how it differs from that of a novel. You did a great job in your description as well, and made a compelling case as to why a blog can be considered afuture book."
"My only critiques are grammatical ones. In your summary you saidpeople can subscribe to as many different ones to follow and read each entry. You have a strong voice throughout your entry, however this sentence feels awkward and could be rearranged so I it feels more cohesive with the rest of the entry. 
 
 Then, in your description, when you saidto skydive out of a plain, plain should be plane. 
 
 Thats all I got :) great job!"
"You did an excellent job with this assignment. Your descriptions were very clear and you made a compelling case as to why Pottermore is afuture book. I had never heard of it and you made me want to go check it out myself. You have a great tone to your writing that made your entry enjoyable to read. I love your last line and the idea of technology as a tool tofeed the fans, great imagery (and very accurate I believe). Fans are always hungry for more and are constantly searching for new ways to feed that hunger. Technology offers a great way for fans to connect with the author, as well as other people who have the same interests."
"My only critique is a grammatical one. In the description when you saidA animated and interactive telling of the books, a should be an. 
 
 Thats it :) great job!"
"I loved your entry! It was thoughtful and very creative. You have a great tone that makes your writing enjoyable to read. I loved the way you described the aesthetics of the book, invisible like a ghost. I also liked that you included Gaimans Halloween gift-giving tradition. That history gives the work more solidity. You did a great job in your description and made me want to go download it immediately. You also made a compelling case as to why this is aFuture Book. 
 
 Bibliobibuli is a great word by the way, I actually had to look that one up :)"
"Um...well...I really don't have much. What can I say, you did a great job. I guess you could give us a quick line describing what the story is about. I think that could make your description stronger."
This was a great entry. Your description was excellent and by far your greatest strength in this assignment. It was very detailed and I could clearly imagine the book in my head.
"This was certainly the most creative idea I've read. The idea that we are all stories is one that I firmly believe. It's a great concept. I like the way you portrayed all the footprints we are creating through photographs, videos, facebook, twitter, instagram, etc. Our great grandchildren will have a far more accurate account of our story than we have of our own great grandparents. What I also like about this concept is that our stories never really end. Our story is part of our parents' story and our friends' stories and many other stories that are constantly overlapping and weaving together throughout the years."
"Your summary is very unclear. Even in your description I wasn't entirely sure where you were headed. I didn't fully understand what your entry was about until I read the ""Future Factor"" section. Creating a clear summary and immediately describing what this ""Future Book"" actually is will strengthen your whole assignment tremendously."
"This entry was very interesting, particularly for those who are interested in science fiction novels. The description of the book's synopsis is what makes it really captivating. The student started their description with a question bringing the reader in as if we were reading the back cover of the book."
"It was a very good entry with very little I can find wrong. The future factor is well described and I feel I have a grasp on what Unbound is all about. Additionally, the student explained why this way of writing publishing could be popular in the future. The student also gave us a taste of what his/her full field entry will look like with a clear and well lit picture. I suppose if I wanted to see anything more, it would be more about the history/inspiration of the book."
"This entry is actually very realistic and makes a convincing argument for the popularity of orality over reading with examples of existing podcasts and other media today. Similarly, although the future factor contains a lot of hypotheses there seems to be enough realism to make it believable such the expense of printing and digital."
I feel the student's entry for future factor could do without the first three sentences. The student could easily use more examples of how the podcast is increasingly popular and what advances it is already making as well as why it will be more popular later.
"The students gives a wonderfully detailed description of his/her future book. The format was thoroughly explained enough for me to understand what I would be getting into without the student actually giving away the story. The student also made a great point in their future factor about how creative format books such as ""House of Leaves"" would not be able to be e-books or digitized."
"The part about ""Alice"" met the challenge of the Assignment. I liked the idea of being in Hogwarts and walking around and looking at notes! Maybe the author could set these scenarios up in such a way that the curious are rewarded."
I think the references to Nelson and Coupland were unnecessary. I think Alice covered all your bases on this assignment.
A very spirited campaign for the blog! I could see how reading a blog could approximate the book-reading experience for you.
"But will the blog replace the book? I see them co-existing as they do presently, but unless blogs progress in some way, I am not seeing the ""future book"" part."
Description was strong. Many good points and examples. I listen to podcasts often while working myself.
"Future factor was weak. Reference to Konstantinou seemed only tangentially related. You seems do be saying podcasts are the future because publishing might be shut down...? Are you saying in the future, there will be no blogs? If there is no internet, how are the podcasts disseminated? I'm sorry, I was confused by this."
"Future Factor was strong, but it did not match Summary and Description. Future Factor section had a great idea for future book format and good points about how fast technology is moving."
Is the answer documentary films or a book with digital capabilities? You answered the assignment with two different forms. I would say stick with the latter and re-write #1 & #2.
This was a great example of a story in a new-ish format. It made me interested in seeing and reading the comic!
"Not sure how this is the future if it is now...? Also, can it be read on a phone or is size sometimes still a consideration for this format?"
I think the subject of the field guide was well chosen. This is an interesting competitor in a very new and exciting space. You did a great job of conveying the sense of newness and excitement for the 3 different programs. I agree that interacting with books in the future could be heading in this direction.
"The persepective in section 2 confused me a little bit. It was almost more like a sales pitch or business case from the IDEO company than a field guide entry. I think the field guide entry should contain observations from an outside observer. I would remove the sense that the author has some sort of insight into the IDEO company motives for creating the programs and provide a more in-depth description of how the interface between the programs works.
 
 
 
 Section 3 could also use more objectivity. It reads like one who is partial to this particular program."
"My only criticism of this is that I would like the focus to be aimed more closely at the actual books hosted on Pottermore. The focus of the assignment should be specifically what constitutes the future of the book. The format of the books on Pottermore may be the way of the future. Maybe someday all books will be hosted on a centralized website, like libraries of the future, with interactive material being an expected requirement."
"This entry provides a strong sense of what is means to be a future-ready book. I agree with the sentiment that readers in the future will want increased speed, technology, and convenience. The ebook or hybrid book definitely fits the speed, technology, and convenient requirement nicely."
This entry falls short in providing an actual example. Describing all ebooks is too generic for a field guide. I would pick one and explain why the ebook is the future of books through the description of a particular example.
"I love the connection to video games. Video games are growing in such a huge way that it would be easy to conceive of a distant future where movies, TV, and even literature take inspiration from them. This is a very fun and futuristic vision."
Excellent future factor! I have a few friends that hate reading and have switched exclusively to audio books(where possible). I have yet to listen to one but it is clear that this type of format is already catching on. Your particular entry sounds like an improvement on the traditional audio book. Good job.
"This entry focused on the Ideo, a really innovative technology. This entry delves into the specifics of Ideo, and the different concepts that they have developed. It is well-written, and a thoughtful post. It meets the challenges of the assignment by examining such an innovative concept."
"I really enjoyed this entry's selection for the assignment. It was innovative and interesting. The author takes a unique perspective by examining the children's book. As children thrive on constant stimulation, electronic devices are great for kids."
"This entry does an excellent job at incorporating images and text. The author clearly thought about this assignment, and the work is very well-written. The author selected an unique text, and successfully described the book's elements."
"This entry's strength lie in the last section. The production of the book is what makes it futuristic, and it is a coincident that the book also happens to be about the future. The author was also able to include an image, which makes the post stronger. The description section was written very creatively and sounded like something you would read off the back of the book."
"This entry's strength is in thinking outside of the box. I would have never examined a Post Secret book in a futuristic manner, but I understand the logic behind it after reading this entry. This author has a detailed explanation of postsecret.com that aides in understanding the concept. Overall, it is well-written."
This entry clearly defines the Pottermore website and its attributes as an extension of the Rowling series of books. It definitely could be viewed as a futuristic technological leap for books especially this type of story that has an epic quality too it and multiple books contained within a single story line.
"There are quite a few editing errors that need to be made throughout the draft. A close reading should catch them. Otherwise, this site sounds like an interesting website for those interested in the Harry Potter series."
"I love how the author of the entry describes all the parts of the book that make it futuristic. It sounds like the book using the internet in a major way to tell the story and this integration of literature and internet technology definitely speaks to a the future direction of books. It sounds like a great read, I'll have to check out."
"This entry does a great job of capturing the futuristic essence of ""The House of Leaves."" There is great descriptions and focus on the formatting of the text in the story. This appears to be the greatest example of the book's author's forward and futuristic thinking. This too, sounds like a great read."
"This entry does really great at explaining hybrid books and how they are a potential future book type. However, this wasn't the assignment. There isn't a clearly chosen book that is being described just an idea of a book type/genre."
This entry doesn't describe an actual book. It merely covers the idea of what a successful future book would look like. The assignment was to find a book that speaks towards the future and describe it's merits as a future book. This entry doesn't do this at all.
The problem that had me questioning whether it would work as an entry was the fact that two of the three products were things that surrounded and enhanced the use of a book or ebook. I might focus on the last company(?) that actually altered the way we would read books.
"The strength of this entry is the writers passion for reddit. The writer seems very invested in this particular website, and states very vehemently that this site is already replacing books. 
 
 The entry meets the challenge because it is one of the specified examples in the assignment description."
"I would have been interested to read an entry about something other than the style of books that we've already been reading in class, which is what I felt this entry felt like. I don't really have anything else to suggest, I think this article was done really well and its the best one that I reviewed!"
"This entry is not for something that I think everyone can relate to, nor is it something that I think everyone would be interested. I do believe that this is an example of a future book, but I think this entry falls short in every other aspect. I appreciate the fact that this is a more personal example, but I don't think it fits the assignment.
 
 
 
 I think that this can be improved by choosing a topic that everyone can relate to. This is a narrow topic of an example of a future book for one individual, but not for everyone. In this scenario I'm still seeing people having to go out and buy books instead of having easier access to them like ebooks."
"I really wanted to see pictures! I loved the description of the book itself, but I wanted to actually see something instead of just reading about the aesthetics of the book. Also, this definitely needs a more concrete title. The title seems as if this was submitted on accident or out of confusion. Also, please remove ""the subject of this entry"" because that is self-explanatory."
"This entry is about documentaries with a primary focus on the ""Babies"" documentary film. I liked this entry because I felt like it gave a different spin on the project while still meeting the assignment. This is definitely an example of the future of the book. I could see people in the future choosing to watch documentaries to learn about things instead of reading books. As it is, things like furniture and special dog collars already come with DVDs to show you how to use them correctly."
"I really enjoyed the description of how Gaiman reads the script of the book. I thought the summary was straight and to the point as it should have been - easy to understand and immediately know what I was going to read about. As someone familiar with Gaiman's style, but who has not listened to this book, the description of his ""acting"" skills piqued my interested in the project and made me go and physically look up the project online after I finished reading the entry, so I feel that that aspect of the description was well done. It was also helpful to find out a bit of the background of the book, which unlike many other stories is very unique. (which was also an aspect of the assignment, just as the voice of the piece and attempting to motivate people to go and read the piece was). I also felt that the last line of the future section was particularly effective and was a lovely way to end the section by tying in themes of the Gaiman's pieces."
"I think the piece is off to a very good start, in general I think there are just a few places that could be expanded upon with some greater detail. As the author mentions the presentation of the book is unique as an audio book, so in addition the description of Gaiman's voice as the author has done which is very well done, the argument would benefit from describing how that unique experience of being read to instead of reading; not being separated from the author by your own voice, pacing, and tone of reading, or physical page, but instead almost having a ""tangible"" connection to the author and the authors voice changes the reading experience as only an audio book can. Doing so would help to further drive home the point that audio books are a entirely unique experience. I would have also like to have a scene a little bit of a deeper analysis on how audio books could expand reading in the future - again, drive home the point that this format can uniquely change the reading experience over other mediums, not just save time as the author rightfully mentioned."
"I greatly appreciated the use of senses to describe the unique elements of the website in the description section - I also wrote about Pottermore and that was not something I had thought about including in my own description but it really helped to sell the complete atmosphere the site provides not just in content but all the way to its attention to ambiance, which is something unique to web and audio formats that can not be included in the book. The sensory details helped set the stage for the following descriptions of the types of activities users can participate in on the site, helping to show how immersive and expansive the site is and truly showing how individual it is. The summary is also very clear and direct, the reader knows exactly what the entry will be about and what to expect in the following sections."
"The strengths of your Rough Draft are that you explained thoroughly an internet news community to where I did look it up, I had never heard of it before. The problem with the claim that this is ""already the future of the internet"" is that there are so many communities of information, it is sometimes difficult to decipher which carries the most accurate information. However, you could be very right, all the information we now receive is from sources that are not well known, and are put on by anyone, so that is accurate. You did a great job of striking my interest, so, as I said, I did look up your source and I will definitely look at it again for some information."
"Your strength in your rough draft was that you kept my interest and I desired to look up the site that you cited. Everything flowed very well and I think this is an exciting way to jump off from a book into the technology aspect, as not everyone has a computer, but if they desire to go farther than a book, they have the option to do so. Our discussion boards are very similar, as gaining insight from each other aids in our learning and understanding. You taught me something with this, as I did not know it even existed, my mother still goes to book clubs at the local library, and this would definitely prove more convenient."
"Yes. The motion matches the description. I liked the description, it was funny. The rectangle does exactly as it says, staggering to the exit."
"Yes it does, however I think it's Elvis ghost moving southwest because it looks very faint/ghostly the way it moves, but I loved the way that they described the movement. It moves southwest because of (-2, 1) in their code making it take the quickest exit instead of using other ""routes"" or coordinates. It also has that jumpy/zig-zag movement because it randomly jumps between (+/- 4 pixels left; +/- 2 pixels down)."
The animation matches the description and I think the changing colors as the direction changes is also a very nice touch. It matches the behavior in that the walker goes straight then changes direction as it hits a wall.
"Yes it does, it walks forward and then bounces off of the walls. I like that you used random with the colors, it makes an interesting design as it builds upon itself."
"Yes, the motion does match the description of the behavior. I like how it changes color to indicate a different line is being walked by ""the blind person"" every time they bump into a wall. Or even the Rumba description is spot on with your code."
"I do recognize the rumba motion. It's a little bit too slow for demonstration purposes, but it's pretty accurate. Good job."
The motion does match the description very well as it does seem to mimic two painters competing to color one canvas. They do walk extremely fast which makes the dashing of the bright guy a bit hard to see but you can tell that it is there and more prominent than the sad painter.
"Yes. The walker acts normal within a specific area until prompted, and then returns to normal afterwards. I like the mouse movement incorporation."
"I think this patch excellently mimics the description given. Upon reading the description I was a bit skeptical as to whether or not it would look like the motion. But when loading the patch, it fits it very well and is also extremely entertaining to interact with."
It kind of looks like it. It is just really hard for me to get past that they are just squares(or rectangles). But it does what it was supposed to do.
The description and behavior definitely match though there isn't really a story behind it. Maybe the spiral represents a bug flying in a spiral towards the screen but then dies cause it hit the screen. However I really love the coding you did for this. It looks beautiful.
It's wonderful. The sounds are entertaining and grasp the meaning of positivity and negativity.
The approach is perfect. I learned that UI and presentation mode in Max is very critical to developing a successful patch.
"The header is very creative, presenting the challenge of attempting to locate the good key. It presents a nice, inviting title and lays out the challenge before you while still being minimal. The master sound button is a great idea, saving the viewer a little time by not having to scroll down and switch each individual sound button on. The logistic part of the patch, though, is much the same as we were presented in class, with a little extra fuddle and detracting clunkiness included."
"Once the master sound button has been toggled to active the process becomes as simple as pressing different keyboard buttons until the right one has been pressed.; in this case it is ""P"". The sounds are clear in relaying to the user the information of the keyboard button, good or bad, but seem like stock audio samples that lack originality and are devoid of personality infusion on part of the programmer. The design is nice, but the sounds aren't entertaining to hear repeatedly, so after two/three times, I stopped the program."
"It has a logical flow, but there are two ending speakers that it can lead to. This could have been simplified. There is only one comments, and it is not specific enough if the person is unfamiliar with the program."
It is very simple and not particularly interesting in any way. I am somewhat bored by the simple sounds.
"There are two ending speakers/end points. This could have been simplified to making it only one speaker. 
 
 
 
 They could have left in the comments what key number 100 is."
The patch looks very clean and well put together.
"The patch works perfectly, the D key plays back a ringing bell while all the other keys play back a snair drum."
"The patch is impressive and works well, I think that they even added in some extra steps along the way that made the patch even a little cooler."
"The patch feels simple and clean, seemingly trying to be easily understood rather than technically efficient."
"It feels great to use. The sounds are simple and quick, making it easy to identify what key I've hit. The sounds end quickly which gives enough of a response to know if I hit the right key or not."
"The patch uses two different sfplay~ objects, one for success and one for failure, which makes the patch look easier to understand even if not as technically efficient. I've learned that simplicity can come from making it technically less simple, although it's not surprising or exciting. I am not sure what could have been done better."
The patch looks simple and logical.
"The experience is simple and mechanical with little conceptual salience, but there's still a sense of elementary investment in the patch's function. I'm happy when I hear the ""success"" song instead of the ""failure"" song."
"There isn't any major technical innovation here, but everything works fine."
The look of the patch is very organized and easy to understand.
My experience with the patch is that it's very goofy. It was difficult to find the key because it wasn't a letter. So I just pressed every key till I could find it.
"No, while the assignment was very organized and clean, they didn't really do anything exciting. I didn't learn anything from it. They couldve added extra sounds to make it better."
Very simple and easy to read vertically from top to bottom. Same as in class.
"Simple coding like in class, nothing different other than the sound files and the correct key. The comments on the side somewhat gave away the correct key though. I mean, I know it was there for the coder's purpose but for someone who did not know and was trying to figure it out, I would have renamed the sound files to something more incognito as well as the comment."
"The patch looked very nice and professional. It seemed to contain all the correct pieces and buttons so based on appearance, I would give it an A."
"I thought the sounds were very creative. Now I had my volume on super loud so my first press and the ""W"" key was a bit shocking but after the initial shock I was good. The sounds themselves were actual song pieces which I really enjoyed. It was entertaining, energetic, and I would have fun playing around with this patch."
"This particular patch looks very professional to me. It is as cleaned up as it can be. As I have said, I did enjoy the fact that they added songs in place of a voice for the yes and no key. Did I learn how it was done based on the patch itself, no. However, I am no eager to do so. Honestly, there is not much more to be done to this patch to perfect it. It's self explanatory and easy as can be."
The folder wasn't labeled so I had to open it to see who files I was looking at. The patch was very simple and clean. There are a couple of toggles that I didn't see the purpose for.
The patch was simple and easy to navigate. The sounds are entertaining.
I found the coding to be basically the same as shown in class. The two extra switches I thought maybe could have been removed. The sound was original as well.
"The patch appears to be very nice, and well put together."
The patch works fine and emits both a yes and a no sound.
The patch is good it takes two different types of sound to play which is a good mix.
this is a good patch it combines two different type of sound and its cool to listen to.
The buttons used are great and they get the job done right with the sounds. The no sound is a simple gong which is better than just saying no and the yes button is cheerful music like the type you receive when you beat a level in a video game.
This patch was very clean and put together nicely. All components were accurately described and neatly placed.
"When running the patch, I couldn't get the sounds to play unless I clicked the ""ezdac"" object. This may be a Max thing though, so I wouldn't discredit the creator for it. Prior to critiquing, I had been listening to music, so when the evil laugh played, I actually jumped a little in my seat because it was so loud. I got a laugh out of it, and smiled fondly when I found the right key and recognized the Beavis and Butthead(or what I assumed them to be) laughs. The sounds are goofy with a touch of terror that still has my heart pumping a bit from the surprise. One thing is for sure, I'll be turning my sound down a bit when moving on to the next critique."
"The patch was pretty standard in terms of technical setup. It followed the tutorial correctly. As mentioned above, the maniacal laugh was pretty surprising. I cant imagine what people with headphones might have done. The sounds chosen did get a bit annoying after multiple key presses, so using multiple laugh tracks might help with the monotony that tends to occur after multiple attempts. In the future I might suggest labeling your files with your name or some kind of identifier - especially if an instructor is going to be looking at it."
It's very simple. Text states clearly how to make the patch function and what it will do.
"It's entertaining. The laughter provokes memories. The ""bad key"" is kind of creepy while the ""good key"" is humorous."
"Looks similar to the example in class, easy to follow, uses the open features along with the names of the files."
"Very entertaining to use, made me laugh just like the patch did, and it was easy to tell which key was the odd one out."
"The audio was the most surprising thing, most of the patch looked similar to the class example but it was the audio that made it unique."
"When I first hit a ""wrong"" key, I thought I'd hit a ""right"" one, in that the sound of the evil laugh seemed so much more final than the Bevis and Butthead one. The whole thing felt a little goofy, but that's to be expected in a design that's all laughs."
"The whole thing was incredibly straightforward. I'd have preferred something a little more out of the box, particularly when we were given some degree of freedom. It works exactly how it was assigned, and I feel it's a little boring."
The look and feel is simple.
"The ""no"" sound was startling, and the ""yes"" sound was comedic and nice to hear."
"The ""yes"" key wasn't a letter, but a number key, which I thought was interesting."
The patch looks similar to the patch made in class. It feels generic.
"This student approached the assignment seemingly to complete it without adding anything new or special, so there is nothing surprising or exciting. I didn't learn anything, as it wasn't unique compared to what we have done in class. It's hard to say what could have been done better since we haven't learned much in class."
Looks and feels very similar to the patch built in class.
the good key sound is very entertaining.
"Before even using the patch, I could tell that program would run smoothly. It was well laid out and designed, nice and clean."
"After playing with the patch, I thought it was fun. I liked the user's sounds a lot. I could tell the user is a goofy person because when you found the good key, it played the ""oooh-yeah,"" from Ferris Bueller's Day Off."
"The patch technically speaking was basically the same layout as instructed in class. However, they did a good job overall. I especially liked the sound files."
The buzzer sound for hitting the wrong key was really loud and annoying to hear over and over again.
"Technically, the patch worked perfectly, but there was nothing exciting about it."
"It's a very simple lay out. Very bare bones, and minimalistic. No real explanations to what everything does, outside of the 'good' and 'bad' buttons, but the path to each part if pretty easy to figure out."
"Technically, it wasn't anything complicated, and nothing experimental about it. Because of how simple it was, I didn't learn anything new and nothing jumped out at me. Which is fine since the path to each part was laid out to where it should be. Maybe adding a level meter in just to give the user an idea of how loud everything is, and possibly making sure before using a sound that it's not too loud for the user. Other than that, it was a pretty good patch."
the victory sound was a bit too long. but i felt like i watching a movie intro or playing a game
They didn't do anything exciting or surprising but they made the patch as simplistic as possible and I almost think that's better than any extra elements. It makes it so the patch is very easy to read and the user can understand everything that's taking place.
"It's a very simple patch, it's easy to understand the signal flow."
"The failure sound is really annoying, I suppose that it makes the user more motivated to find the success sound, but the game requires hearing the fail sound over and over. It would be better if it was a softer, shorter, less annoying sound, or had volume controls so I don't have to endure it."
"This patch is very simple and easy to understand, but it isn't very user friendly. Adding a few comments to tell the user to load the sample and turn on the sound, for example, would make the patch easier for the user."
"The patch was simple and straight forward with an ease of design. They did add a ""victory"" and ""loser"" aside to a ""yes"" or ""no"" which added to the whole video game music choice. I did do a similar design and structure."
"Surprised to see something so simple, was expecting something a little more elaborate. In general it was aesthetically clean and pleasing."
"Very easy to use and the instructions in the information box made it clear as to what to expect. The sounds worked well, somewhat goofy but entertaining. Generally effective even though slightly over simplistic."
This patch looks different from the other ones I've looked at so far. It was definitely interesting. I would assume this person has prior knowledge of Max as this patch appears to be a bit more advanced. It was set up as a project with multiple folders instead of a single patch.
"I had trouble figuring out what I was supposed to do. The directions were a little too cryptic for me, and while I might just be too new at Max, I feel like the average beginner might have been as confused as I was. The sounds were kind of hard to understand as well. I could barely tell what either of them were saying - if it hadn't been for the note, I don't think I would have made out the ""amen"" correct key sound."
"I think that the patch that you made is pretty clean, and unique. I didn't see the selective key in that which is an excellence idea to hide it."
"I think that the coolest thing of your work is that you used the sub patch, so you are able to hide the ""Good key"" form the user."
simple yet obviously complex
0
they did something nobody else did. a step up from the orig. assignment.
"This look is completely different from the rest of the patchers i have seen today and it is very unique and makes me wonder what it will do, it comes with instructions on how to use it and it has a short simple design."
It seems like an advanced form of patch because i did not quite understand how to get it to work. It says that the sound file is amen and in order to play it you have to from a new word from the word amen. It is a bit confusing.
I eventually got it to work after reading the instructions carefully but overall the patch itself looks short at a glance and there is a sub patch that actually does all of the work in it and i think that is pretty fancy.
Pretty simple patch. Not complicated.
"I cant get the sound to load at all. I dont know if the problem is on my end, but the last patch worked for me."
Couldnt get it to work.
"The patch looks well organized in terms of visually clean, the connectivity of the patch is very sharp and visually appealing. The terms associated with the yes, patch are sounds that would be an obvious strong indication of the, positive, ""yes"" or negative ""no""keys. Prior to interacting with the program I couldn't actually see the speaker connected to the rest of the model or the meter."
"The patch is clear and easy to use. I like that there is a button that I can press to activate the wav files instead of hunting for thegood Key, or an ascii code map. I like the meter and the level meter attached to the sfplay object, it helps to know that the sound is playing."
"I like the patch, it is clean and simple. I like the color sound meter."
I love the sound. The audio is an actual person talking not just tones.
The overall feeling I got when looking at the patcher was that it was cleanly laid out. My personal preference would be to line up the edges of the bottom boxes with the edges the message patches above. A minor point!!!
I figured out how to open finally!!! Catchy recordings
lThis is the basic minimum nothing was done beyond the tutorial

"The coding assignment was formatted and completed the same way as it was done in class, but there was an additional sound meter added.
 
 
 
 They could have left comments such as what key number 97 is."
"I think that the patch that you made is clean, and well organized."
"I love the music that you picked. The quality of the sound is pretty good, and the style is really unique, and not clichÃ©. I'm really enjoy playing this interactive."
"I think you did a good jobs, and also picked a really impressive music, however I think that you might be able to try something more advance or more creative."
"Looks like the class example, clean and easy to read. only thing that differs a bit is the volume control."
"Feel very simple to use, the only thing was the volume control has a setting so at first even when I turned the speaker on I couldn't hear it. After a little time I was able to figure it out."
"The sounds varied a bit compared to the class example, it was a little more pleasing then hearing just ""yes"" and ""no"" over and over again."
It felt rather complicated and guideless.
"It felt confusing due to the lack of directions on the sound bar. With that, it lead to the patch being rather complex."
"It was approached in a different way than what the lecture taught, which is always welcome. What the creator could do is to explain the features of the patch so new users don't get lost on it."
"The presentation is very plain, and looks like they didn't customize it. It is kind of symmetrical, but it looks like they finished it and didn't experiment."
The sounds didn't work for me at first and I had to mess with the live.gain~ function before it made any noise. The actual audio clips were nice and soothing.
"They used the live.gain~ operation, which I was unfamiliar with, so it's cool that they tried something different. But it didn't play sound at first which is basically all it needs to do. They are also the first person who didn't have the YES key blatantly showing, so that's great."
It is minimalistic and neat. It feels easy to follow if you know introductory knowledge of Max/MSP.
"I'd say it feels like the ""average"" good key bad key game where you quickly sort through the key choices until you find the right one, guessing roughly where it might be based on the key print feedback. It feels a bit more beautiful than goofy based on the audio feedback. It still leads me to feel mildly amused and more engaged with playing with the audio as it's a bit more appealing."
i couldn't get it to work with keyboard buttons just the on screen buttons but i liked it still and the sounds were simple yet effective
only thing i would change would be to get it to work by pressing keyboard buttons
"It looks like there is no actual selection operator for the good key or bad key. There are comments however but they didn't seem to relate to the content of the patch. My question is: were they trying to use the MATCH object, but didn't use it successfully?"
"Did not work. There was no operator to select a good or bad key. The wav files were pleasant to listen to, a soft ""hello"" and ""goodbye"" with a very nice voice. It made me want to use the patch but I could only press the open operator to make the patch play a sound."
"Not adequate, extra simple patch and concept but it still did not work."
The patch looks well organized though I am not entirely sure the purpose of the boxes that say what is.. and awkward. It is easy to understand the flow of the code.
"I was not able to make any sounds happen, and I did not see a select function used so the program seems to be struggling to complete the required code. It is easy to see where I am typing, however."
Code not complicated.
I could not get the sound to work with the keyboard. Only by pushing the open buttons on the patch. I am not sure if this is a problem on my end though.
Couldn't get it to work properly.
"It looks very basic, much like mine."
I could not get the keys to trigger sounds.
"They did the basic requirement, but I was unable to trigger the actual sounds."
"Feels like the class example, simple to read, and this one has text boxes with directions which make it a bit easier to read."
"Sounds were entertaining, I enjoyed the ""whoosh"" a bit more than the ""yes and no"" shown in the example."
"Coding system similar to that of class example, only difference was the sounds, maybe a few different sounds added in to the mix would have helped."
The patch looks nice but with a few extraneous pieces. Unfortunately there is a note telling me exactly which key is the right one so I didn't have to look for it. It kind of defeats the purpose of this patch.
"The sounds were unimpressive. They are just two random noises. They don't feel ""right"" or ""wrong"". If I didn't know what the patch was supposed to do, I wouldn't even know if I had hit the correct key because the sounds are just random, no good or bad feeling to them."
"Technically, the patch was perfect. Though there was nothing original about it except the sounds, it did what the assignment asked."
The feel of this particular patch is very clean cut and to the point. The symmetrical alignment of the objects helps create a simple yet effective vibe.
"Using the patch, I didn't ever feel like it wasn't working well, however, I was not really engaged. I didn't truly enjoy searching for the ""good key"" because the sound font didn't draw in my interest. This lead to a one-dimensional experience as in, I was just observing the functionality of the patch."
"The coding assignment was very similar to the screencast. The one exception being that they placed buttons before the 'open' messages. For someone who was unfamiliar with Max or any kind of code, I felt it enhanced the patch from a visual aesthetic and also let the user clearly see what the patch was doing. I think that this was where I was forced to wrap my mind around something. Some could argue that the buttons are unnecessary and it might have a pure simplicity without them."
"It looks and feels a bit complicated, as if there is too much going on the screen at once."
Both 'yes' and 'no' give a response that I would expect. The 'yes' is positive and the 'no' is negative.
"The student added in an extra tool for showing the audio level, yet besides that, there is nothing surprising or exciting. It seems that they tried to add more to it, even with the little we have learned in class. It's hard to say what could have been done better."
"The patch is laid out well, and looks nice. There are lots of comment boxes and everything is a nice distance away from is each other."
The sounds are movie quotes and take longer amount of time to run than the other sound bits. The meter and levelmeter both light up and provide a visual feedback as well as the sound.
"I really like how things are laid out in this patch, it is pleasant to look at. They did show the winning key however, which doesn't make the game much 'fun'. There are some added functions like the meters which give the patch more personality."
"I think that the patch that you made is really clean, and well organized. I also saw that you have a decibel meter to measure the sound, which is really cool to me."
"I think that the sound that you picked is really funny, so I'm really enjoy using it."
"I think you did a good jobs, and also picked a really funny music. The most impressive thing in your project is a decibel meter to measure the sound, however I think that you might be able to do something more creative."
"This patch is neatly arranged. I noticed that in addition to the regular meter, they also had a level meter, which was new."
"I think the sounds used where really unique. I was thoroughly amused by both the Spongbob and Austin Powers soundbites. I seem to enjoy the projects that can make me laugh more than the others, and this one definitely did the trick. The patch was straightforward and easy to use. I found myself searching for the right key even though it was outlined in a comment, just to keep hearing the sounds."
It looks like the patch that was assigned to us!
"The yes sound nice, but the no sound is the sound that most macs make when pressing a wrong key so I was confused for a second. That was clever actually. 
 
 The buttons lit up in different colors, that was a good idea."
"Nothing here really surprised me, I liked the colors on the buttons. And the sound choice made me think I was not even clicked on Max so yeah that was a good idea."
"It looks pretty basic, with some added features like the meter and color feedback from the bangs of incorrect and correct key choices."
"It's amusing that they used the traditional mac error sound and the other sound for the correct key press was generally pleasing. It feels pretty easy to use, mildly aesthetically and audibly pleasing and neatly organized. It gives a pretty good experience, but this game gets old pretty quickly after you've played it a handful of times."
"They did more than the minimum for this assignment so kudos for going through the little extra effort to beautify your patch. I learned I could easily have added color to my patch for a slightly more pleasing experience. Also, people will definitely hate my ""wrong"" sound and that's sadistically pleasing."
"Overall, the design was fairly simple with very few alterations to what the instructor created in class."
"The sounds were entertaining to listen to; ""Funk.wav"" was pretty funny to listen to."
Nothing very exciting or surprising was noticed in this project since all elements of the assignment were similar to the instructor's design.
The look and feel was simple.
"At first I thought my computer wasn't working because of the generic sound that Mac's usually make when a key doesn't work, but it was actually the ""no"" key."
"The patch was simple, one ""yes"" key."
Looks like it could be tighter/organized slightly more.
At the moment I cannot hear the sound files of any of the programs because I am not on a Mac I think. Patch appears to be working correctly based on the buttons lighting up.
The approach was pretty straightforward ad followed the in class instructions.
"At a glance the patch looks good, there is plenty of room and space for it to be seen without confusion and it comes with some handy tips and comments on how to get it to work if you do not find the key it has the answer so it does not frustrate you. The overall look is simple yet amazing."
One of the sounds was funny it made me chuckle but the no sound was a simple no which i would of preferred it to make another sound other than the obvious no or incorrect try again.
The patch overall worked perfectly and it was amusing and it follows the assignment just right when it comes to requirements and layout. I actually did learn how and where they acquired the sound bar from because i could not find that for my project which i know would have been helpful for those who maybe could not hear it.
The overall feel of the patch is very technical and clean. The patch looks similar to the one done in class and has nice layout.
The sounds are goofy and funny. They make you want to do the patch over and over again because the sounds are entertaining to listen to. It leads a very pleasing and funny experience for the user.
They approached the coding assignment very typically. The patch looks similar to the tutorial done in class. They added the meter for extra flare. I did learn that I should have used more comments in my own patch since it can be very confusing without them.
Looks very basic.
It was kinda funny. The militaristic samples rose a chuckle out of me.
They did the basic requirement.
conceptually it was compartmentalized.
there are several ways to code. this student opted to keep things seperate instead of coding together.
goofy. the sounds used are goofy.
"abrupt. Others took time to make the code elegant, long, or truncated, but you could see the connections. Inputs & outputs. None are seen here."
"The patch was clean and simple, once again I noticed the extra toggles. There was no media lines used so it felt kind of plain."
The patch didn't feature a comment telling me which key was the right key. I was forced to push buttons in an attempt to find the right one and the no sound became annoying. I didn't really enjoy the search because of the no sound.
"Small boxes in general, somewhat squishy and close but it does not take away from the performance of the patch. Same like the one in class."
"Seriously kind of aggrivated. I understand why the coding was so squished now, because the key to activate it was control and the v key. And no, I did not figure it out on my own, I looked it up because I was so annoyed I kept hearing high ho silver awaaaay. When I finally heard the correct sound I was a bit confused, but I guess it makes sense it was talking about teeth and having silver plates on them or else it could cause gingivitis? I don't know, didn't understand that joke.."
"Since it was condensed in size, it definitely took more time to find the right key(S), PLURAL. It was definitely surprising because I literally went down the rows of keys trying to match the numbers. I learned that to be sneaky and troll people, don't show all the connections so that people can get frustrated and slam their keyboard...no I didn't do that.."
"I only got one of the sounds to trigger - the ""no."" The Ace Ventura sounds were cool and all, but only if it actually works."
"The patch works great, and responds to the keys accurately."
"The sounds are awesome and unique, this is a very well done patch."
"This patch is very simple, and it's easy to understand the signal flow."
"Firstly, the sounds are fantastic. The creator expertly utilizes the concept of ""cuteness"". Even though the patch is very simple, the fact that it makes ""human"" sounds gives it an air of humanity."
"Visually this patch is extremely sharp looking. The cable line that he used to connect the components look like a piece of art work in itself, with a very mechanical feel. The patch looks very straightforward and user friendly, and followed the guidelines of the assignment exactly."
"I thought the user experience was overall very strong with this patch, not only from visual aesthetics, but from the functionality as well. The sounds were entertaining, especially the good key. The sounds were definitely goofy, which make the user interface more fun."
"This patch was techinically very visually creative and functionally as well. I did learn to try to stretch myself creatively in terms of trying to program my patch to have an artistic quality as well, and not just merely connect components for functionality purposes, included stretching creativity in sounds waves as well. I do not really have any recommendations for improvements, I think they did a great job."
"Looks similar to class example but minus the ""numbers"" box to see exactly what number this was, this made it a bit tougher."
"The sound was sort of boring at first...but then I found the ""yes"" button and it made me laugh for quite a while, good use of the file."
"Coding was very similar to class example, easy to follow, and it had quite an entertaining outcome."
I really liked this patch. It was super creative and the sounds were perfect. The good key sound is one that continues on its own for quite some time so its as if it is actually speaking to you and I personally thought it was very funny. This particular patch makes me want to try harder and make more creative and funny sounds.
"The patch followed the guidelines perfectly. This patch did not contain each step by step explanation for each button which I have been used to seeing. However, it works perfectly, it is still easy to navigate and I don't think anything could have been done differently."
Nothing new from what we did in class and they layout could have been a little tidier. May have been cool to add some graphics? A good reminder that we need to push our creativity if we want to come up with something truly original!
"Looks good, everything all lined up. I like it."
"I honestly could not get it to play anything. I can open each .wav file in the folder to find out what I'm supposed to hear, but I can't replicate that in the patch. There also wasn't a level meter, so I had no idea if sounds were actually playing or not, or if there was a problem on my end with my speakers. I really wanted to know if I could play 'Sweet Home Alabama'."
I felt like I was in Vegas for a minute.
This is perhaps the most basic incarnation of this particular assignment. The sounds are predictable and obvious in their connotation.
"I enjoy the use of different color buttons for notifying when the Good/Bad key is struck. Very simple, easy to navigate."
It feels very simple to use. It's stated exactly what you have to spell out in order to hear both sounds and activate the good/bad key. I enjoy the sounds.
"I like the concise look and minimal use of space. The author still gives the message, but without a lot of looking around. It feels like the author copied the template, made it more concise, and added their own versions of yes and no."
It is easy to use though I had to do some guessing to find the good key. I enjoyed the futuristic sounding files and it reminded me of space mountain. It would be well used with some kind of space ship cockpit.
"So far this patch is the smallest I've seen. Everything is very condensed which almost makes it look clustered but also gives the patch a sense of unity. It's very clear everything works together and makes the patch seem like a whole thing rather than a bunch of parts working together. This aesthetic is very interesting, I haven't seen it before."
"This one was actually a lot of fun! I loved how the good key's sound started off the same as the bad key's. I can definitely see someone just pressing the keys one after another and completely missing the sound, which is amusing to imagine. The sounds overall reminded me of the inside of a sci-fi movie spaceship."
I think the way they organized the patch was surprising; a lot of people had their patch spread out far apart and made sure the user could separate the different parts easily. This patch sort of bunches everything together giving it a new feel. I don't think there's anything they need to do to improve their assignment.
This patch looked a little to clumped together. I think it would look more clear and professional if there was more space in between each of the keys. I also don't see the a button that explains the letter that represents the good key so I'm unsure which key to hit.
"The patch itself is pretty good, the sounds are funny and entertaining. Its a decent patcher but I actually did have to hunt down the specific good key which took a little time but then again that is the point of this assignment so all in all its a delightful patcher. The space sounds blew me away."
"Very simple, I like it."
I wouldn't use sounds that have such similarities unless you are trying to confuse your audience.
It looks nice and simple. Very small and compact.
at first glance the patch looked complicated. however the patch notes were helpful.
This patch was very entertaining. it almost had a soundboard feel and I just wanted to make custom mixes of train sounds.
the patch uses the same formula shown in class but adds more sound and key options.
It looks fairly organized and well constructed. It feels very straightforward and efficient.
"I think it works very well. The sounds are cool and offer a kind of variety, so that was nice. The experience was always unique due to the variations in the sounds which made it that much more entertaining."
"I think the patch looks really cool. I learned a few new things like the counter. As I went through it, I thought of ways to make it simpler, but Overall, I think it looks really good. Great Job!"
Before I ran the patch the overall look and feel was very confusing to me at first. I was unsure how it worked together. I have limited experience with Max and this may be my reason for my confusion but I do think it could be a little more cleaned up.
"I think you did a very good job technically working on this. Although the code was confusing to me, after I played around with the sounds for a while it was easier to see how it works. You also did a good job explaining the changes that you made, making it easier to understand. After looking at your code and the changes made on it from what we did in class, I learned a few new ways to connect the keys and make it so there is multiple ""good keys"" and ""bad Keys""."
"Kind of confusing. It seems as though Tom tried to create two different Good Key Bad Key patches and put them together to form one. It seems that he experimented and tried to create a more advanced, more complex version of what we made in class."
"I'm still a little unclear about how this patch works. Instead of just one ""Good Key"" there are two different ""Good Keys"" which play two different sound files of trains. The ""Bad Keys"" play the sound of 2 more different trains that alternate back and forth every time you hit a bad key. I find this to be rather confusing because all four of the train sounds are very similar to each other and it's hard to comprehend which keys are ""good"" and which keys are ""bad."" In total there are 5 different sound files present in this patch, which I kind of don't understand. I wasn't able to hear the fifth sound, which apparently was a bell that was also supposed to match with a specific key."
"I appreciate the fact that Tom tried to do something different with his project and expand upon what was taught in class, but I do think he could have organized it better and chosen sounds that aren't extremely similar to each other. There is just a lot going on in this patch and I think it should have been simplified."
I'd like it better if things were more organized. I have to look in many different parts of the display box to see what is what.
They approached it exactly as we did in the classroom. I didn't really learn anything from what they did because it's very similar to mine. I would at least organize the different objects.
Looks very simple and similar to the patch shown in class. does not have any notes.
the experience is very simple but it works.
again. very simple.
Simple to look at. Nothing different or unusual about the patch. Basically what we learned in class. There were no comments on the patch to let me know what the good key was.
"I liked the music patch of the good key, it went well with the symbol sound of the bad key. There was definitely a reward there for the effort to find the good key."
Technically simple. I would have liked an overlap of sound that two speakers would have given the patch. It would have made it more fun to use.
"The patch looks somewhat like a copy of the patcher example, but with some stuff removed and moved around. It is clean, but does not seem to have a particular orginization attached to it."
"It is the most difficult experience I ran in to because I could not find key 110 and the author did not tell me which one it was. Granted, if the purpose of the code was to find the key, then the author completed this marvelously. I was also still able to listen to the sounds, and this helped further the appeal."
"They also seemed to follow the pattern laid out in class, without adding anything additional. This completed the assignment but did not go overboard in any way."
The look of the patch is virtually the exact same as our example from class last week.
"The patch feels identical to the example, as for usage. The sounds for the ""bad"" keys sound like a hi-hat or other cymbal on a drum kit, and the ""good"" key plays a full groove for almost 10 seconds. Overall, it's simple, and does what we wanted it to."
"Like I said before, it is virtually identical to the example from class. I would suggest cleaning up the patch cords and organization of objects a little more."
"The aesthetic look of the patch is appealing and it has all the components with some of the other patches have been missing. The design of the patch is predominantly on a vertical plane, but here is uniformity and it looks balanced with how the components were placed. It looks user friendly and well defined."
"I think the coding was approached very well within the constraints of the assignments, meaning there was no other new or different technical components. However, it looks like they really did master the patch that they did complete. The only improvement I could make is to be more aware of the artist element of design within the patch. For example, the cables connecting the components could be connecting in a way to create more of artist representation of the piece."
"I think that the patch that you made is really clean, and well organized. I also saw that you have a decibel meter to measure the sound, which is really cool to me."
"I think that the sound that you picked for the wrong key is really funny,and the one that you picked for the right key is really amazing, I was so surprised when I heard it, so I'm really enjoy using it."
"I think you did a good jobs, and also picked a really awesome music. The most impressive thing in your project is a decibel meter to measure the sound."
Looks very basic.
"I liked the samples used. Trying to remember where the sample for the ""good key"" is from. Sounds familiar."
