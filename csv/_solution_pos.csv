I think if you expanded on what you wanted your music playing device would do or even look/ sound like it would have stretched your thinking a bit more.
"If I was your partner Id suggest adding visuals to make it more of an installation. I am not much of a sound girl so I would like to come up with some visuals to add to your abstract music piece. Do the different sounds have to by programmed to keys or can we think of a more interesting way to ""play"". Or are the sounds you play the important part of your project? Is it strictly abstract or can there be a way for the user to express themselves having more control???"
"Using the ideas laid out with creating music using RGB values, I think we could make something that also looks at everyday objects and people to create music in an experimental manner."
"On the first and third questions they had a pretty solid idea, but question two they failed to put really any effort or real thought into. The first idea could be fleshed out better in terms of how the physical presentation would look like as well as why their idea is important and what the goal of it is.
 
 
 
 1. A very simple midi keyboard program for a computer.
 
 2. Another ipod? 
 
 3. A program that reads color and turns it into music."
"A program that uses the keyboard controller they proposed in the first idea, but instead of just playing & recording music, the keys would also play colors that the creator would match up to certain notes or sounds according to their perception of emotion."
"The first and third ideas seem most plausible. Combining the two, we could make certain noises when different targets are hit. Expanding on just the third idea, we could make a few different environments for the target simulator. Maybe something as simple as the silhouette targets police use in a shooting range, or as complex as a city street/alley/etc."
I think that the video game idea using lasers is possible to accomplish this semester. But maybe using a wii remote would work better than using the kinect since there may not be too much motion.
"The glove project is the most interesting project. It is hard to track person's hand moving, I know. But you can develop the idea further. For example, if you can use the glove to remote manipulate some objects. Or even an idea, but I think the introduction video will be awesome."
"If I were to collaborate with this student, I would try and find a good blend between using the oculus rift and glove ideas, with the robot army idea. They both are necessary for eachother, so I think that makes complete sense."
"Honestly, anything I can think of has already been done. My initial thought was to combine 1 & 3, to make a glove that works like a midi controller. However, that was basically done recently by Imogen Heap. Another idea would be to combine the soldier drone suit and the game controller. Just having a full-body controller for VR systems, but that would take more than a semester."
"The virtual reality glove would require a lot of fine-tuning in order to make it complete, and although I don't have much experience with working on hardware, I would be able to work on the software end of the project. Rather than trying to replicate the exact feelings of the player moving their hand, I would shift towards a more game-oriented end goal by programming the glove to sense the user's reason for using their hand then acting accordingly (for example, a grasping hand motion would be registered as the user trying to grab something, which would then cause the user's avatar in the virtual world to grab something). This is more game-focused than the original idea, though it would be the same project overall."
"I'd love to work with the arduino live music control. One thing we could add would be programable visuals with the live music, in order to enhance the live experience. This could be with projection mapping, color recognition, or even animations."
"I'd shift this student's third idea away from live concerts and more towards an app that could simulate what an actual concert might be like given some music, wherever they may be. It would consist of the same features and would focus more on the app's software than interacting with music that is currently playing, allowing users to play a song and change various settings to make it sound as if it was being played live. I would feel that it would be more feasible and more about the technical efforts than interacting with musicians themselves."
"Seeing as how this student is very arts based with design, video, and music, I feel we could work well together as I do myself have many artistic qualities (I am also a musician) but I also have some programming experience to work on the more technical level. I think it would be possible to work on some iteration, if not the complete idea, of the third proposed project. We could probably achieve a basic prototype form through the use of Max MSP I would assume. We could blend their experience of live sound and my capacity to finagle Max."
"Rolling with this idea, the student and I could make an app that would allow people to rate and share experiences of certain routes or part of a city for use by cyclists. Users would record their experiences, along with a positive or negative rating, and link them to a certain area on a map of the city. Overall ratings for different areas would show up over time, giving both locals and visitors a map of safe biking routes and notable places to avoid."
"I am a cyclist myself and have designed my own apps on photoshop, so this actually is interesting to me. Maybe in the app include some of the traffic going on in areas and color coding the safety with the roads."
"You have a great goal, to make cycling safer. If only you wrote down a few more ways to achieve this. A way to report dangers threw an app or something is a great idea. It would give cyclist a voice and push the city to make changes. What other ways can this be done?"
If I was your partner I think Id like to focus on researching the ways large cities are doing this. Id like to propose a way to physically make cycling safer threw lights that interact with cars and the roadways. If we could come up with a way to make communication easier for a cyclist while they ride I think that would achieve some part of your goal. If we could update a rider of upcoming dangers as they ride that would be helpful.
"I could definitely collaborate in making a video or board game with them, creating sketches or doing animation, and I think that would be a lot of fun, especially if it is combined with the other two ideas, into an interactive game, maybe for physical therapy or something. I wouldn't be able to do much with the VR part, but I could definitely help with design."
"It might be interesting to do sort of an augmented reality space - a physical landscape used in a ""game"" in which a user completes tasks/challenges with the aid of things like visual displays (a la Google Glass) and actuator gloves."
"I can imagine his/her project would be foundation stone for future project about the NCVR and AI. If he/she meet and collaborate with designers such as a visual, sound, and media installation person, this project would be great interactive gaming system. This project is quite impressive for me."
I thing a projection based art project would be cool we could make some sort of projection mapping setup that allowed the laser graffiti to be made on a number of different objects.
This student mentioned wanting to do some kind of game and I wanted to do games and incorporate fitness and gaming. So with an arcade game we could find a way to make something that got the body moving. He also wanted to do something with generating power but with water. Well we could make a game that generated power based on body movement. That would be really fun.
"I am very interesting in the third idea. I am also like projecting mapping and interactive project. Base on your idea, I would like to do some ""gun"" game. The gun could have the laser in it, so when you ""shoot"" the wall, the wall will has a ""real"" black hole. On the projection mapping wall, we can create some visual effects that has strong connection with the gun."
"I love the idea of cars running on water. The change to the environment it would make would be spectacular. Also, the laser gun and light graffiti both sound really fun and artistic."
"We could probably make (with a bit of programming knowledge) an awesome game where, as it has been said, draw lines with lasers on a giant projected light wall. The fundamentals seem pretty basic for something that could turn out to be really cool."
"They actually seem to emit a sense of having a clear idea on their heads that may just be much easier to describe with pictures rather than words. i can see their vision, but not much of the whole concept yet."
"Okay:
 
 
 
 I picture this proposition of creating some sort of ""photon graffiti"" that would SOMEHOW work by vandalizing anything you want in an extremely removable way. Maybe something that could last for a few hours only or who knows.
 
 
 
 Maybe I am thinking way too outside the box, let's try again:
 
 
 
 A projector that is kept on for scribbling anything on your wall for reminders and what not, using ""light pens"", and not worry about having a corkboard or whiteboard for everything you wanna plan. Go caveman on it and scribble freely in the room without making an actual mess.
 
 
 
 These sci-fi movies sometimes have these fancy holograms to make a visual explanation of their plans and we could develop something similar, except much more versatile and less impossible like holograms that pop out of thin air."
"I would take idea number 2 because at least we both would be interested in some kind of reform in education funding. We could work on an artpiece that would show how our government allocates money. Since we would be tackling politics, having the funds of billions of dollars would allow us to say whatever is necessary, regardless of what corporations/people are offended."
"My ideas involved animation, and this students ideas involved collaboration/team-building and taking on a major issue (College costs).
 
 
 
 So a joint project might take the form of an exploration of some major problem or concern, and an animation that enhances some aspect of our efforts or our reporting. It might be used to explain the problem, to explain a proposed solution, to explore the issue further, or report on the successes or failures of our efforts. In many things, including animation, a team usually make it easier."
I feel personally that I could help with the first idea of planning things and putting them into motion. One thing I could do would be possibly build some rough prototypical components of some ideas they have to gauge how it might function in a real life application.
"For your semester project goal, I think you might be onto something. Many freshmen come into college shocked at how different it is in comparison to high school, and thus, take a while to get settled down into their new world. Maybe you could construct a game that helps freshmen college student ""learn the ropes"" if it were to how to survive your college experience. Maybe tailor made to ASU instead of a general college survival guide, you could make games that illustrate how to use Blackboard or Ctitviz, maybe include a 3D map of the school in a racing game that subconsciously teaches you how to get around the school campus."
"This student did a great job at stretching their thinking. There are three ideas present, each with their own unique twist on them due to the limitations of either time or money. The first idea is a game, not sure what platform, that calculates reaction time of the user. It would be awesome to have further discussion on what this could be used for; personally, I see this mini-game being used for competition entertainment between friends. The second idea is a group of games used to encourage a healthy and fit lifestyle by using a reward benefactor to motivate people. The third idea touches briefly on the student's passion to expand their gaming company."
"In the past I have worked on classical compositions, musicals, and even post production for short films. In this case, I would love to use my skills in sound design, musical composition, and as a musician to integrate sound and audio into the experience of games. I would love to find a way to use sound in a way that it has never been used for in games to create a dynamic interactive experience in games. On a much more simple note, I would also like to create the theme music for this person's games."
As far as the description of the idea goes it does hit some points. I like the idea of the game for fitness. I'm a little confused about it being an video games or an physical game like sports? I like how it would incorporate on the physical aspect of fitness like using gym equipments for the workout. The incentive on accumulating points is also a great idea. I picture this idea as in the Wii Fit game but not augmented reality? An example on this would be helpful for a visual example.
I would like to work on this project because my idea is about fitness as well. If we can incorporate on kind of campaign about well-fitness and create an event or program that utilize this game I believe this project will be incredible project to work on. If people see there are incentives on exercising and also being fit because the ultimate goal is about fitness and seeing that it is fun to work out they would participate on the event/game.
"My ideas involve animation, and this student's ideas involve gaming (specifically concerning fitness and foundation building for classes).
 
 
 
 So a joint project would probably take the form of a video game. I have done 3D art for video games, and any game that incorporated character animation (as so many do) would align with my main interest in animation."
"I like the idea for the graphic design that would get the world excited about helping make earth a better place to be. I have a similar idea that I think could go along this, adding social media capabilities, and getting as many people involved as possible."
"I think I would want to scale down the second idea. Instead of changing the outside of a building, we could make a projection that alters image based on interaction of viewers in front of a sensor such as a kinect."
"Working on a small game or proof of concept that taught geologic principles through exploration of underground tunnels and caves would be a potential idea. The idea for this is to have students discover different types of rock and geological processes while actually down in the depths of the earth, showing why this information si interesting firsthand."
The three ideas can be combined into one. I am thinking of displaying the wedding book's pictures at the side of the Skyscraper where people passing by can interact with the pictures with their hand movements as though they are playing video games.
"The first idea was a scanable storybook program, that simplifies and makes creating photo albums easy and simple. The second was to create a building that would react to people in, around, and people looking at the building, interacting visually with all of them. The third idea is video game education program, working inside schools and possibly outside. 
 
 
 
 The ideas were sincere but the last idea really could have been explained a bit more, all ideas are good. Especially the building idea, it really makes me wish that existed in a large scale."
"Well working within the education game, you could possible extend the controller of the program into physical space. Using arduino to create physical controllers would be simple and could create a new realm for the game to be played in."
"There are three good ideas present, however not all answers have deeply thought out ideas. I love the ideas but I wish the student would have expanded on their ideas. The first idea is to create a first person shooter game. I like the idea of creating a map/level that can be added to a first person shooter game. It would be awesome to have a game that allowed the game community and its aspiring developers be the creation factor of the maps, levels, and content. The second idea is to build a gaming team to create video games that raise discussion on important topics/issues in the world. These games will also keep the traditional aspect of what a game is. The third idea would be to create an exploration game."
"As I said before, it would be awesome to have a game that allowed the game community and its aspiring developers be the creation factor of the maps, levels, and content. I would love to collaborate and work as the creative/business side of the video game design process. It would be great to work as a team to deliver content to existing games or even new games that promote community driven creation within games. This would give power to the game community, almost like an ultimate sandbox."
"You know what you want to do so the stretching your thinking can be done in the context of your video game. since we are talking about making the world a better place does the game teach the user, inform them, anything other then just entertaining them?"
I would choose to help work on their mobile device application. Although I would try to specialize the app in one particular area like sound and the measurement of decibels. From there I could branch out into using gps tracking data in order to link connections between the decibel readings and the location of the device. This could be used to help find good study locations and develop better studying habits.
"If I was to work with this student, then I would extend the app to maybe act more like a artificial intelligence machine to interact with its users."
They seemed to make a sincere effort and propose three things. The first being to just simply plan ahead as much as possible. The second was to create a non profit company organization that hires law enforcement that uses patrol devices. The third is to showcase a demo of the idea with a mobile app.
"I think this student really thought through what they could do with the time and resources with a project, and came up with some really interesting ideas."
"I'm not sure if the first one is something I would work on with this student, just because I like to create things that are used and help people. Although it's a cool idea, I'm not sure that music or sounds playing when you open the door or touch the handle are something that I would find interesting enough to help on. 
 
 
 
 However, I would definitely be able to help with the other two ideas. I think the mapping is a great idea, especially in a very cultural way. You would be able to discover things with the mapping that you wouldn't normally be able to unless you took a trip all the way there which takes time and money. 
 
 
 
 I would also be able to work on the last one, also possibly working on a fun animation PSA to spread across the country and the world and hopefully be able to get more individuals involved in saving the Earth's resources."
"Only two ideas were provided, but I did feel the classmate gave adequate descriptions of their ideas. 
 
 
 
 1.A project that involves touch and sound. When individuals touched a door handle, this action would trigger different sounds. 
 
 2.Large scale projection mapping. The project might involve projecting related historical videos on large historical monuments. The point of this project would be to give tourist the opportunity to learn about history when visiting historical sites.
 
 3.Classmate would like to work on a project that helps people."
The projection mapping project is of the most interest to me. I believe this project would be best accomplished by developing a large scale projector. I like the idea of helping to teach the general public about history in a new and exciting way.
"There is definitely some vague writing on the third idea - saying ""I don't know,"" but maybe doing some game - but the other two ideas - interactive touch sensors to trigger sound, and projection mapping onto landmarks - are less vague, but not all that original. There are plenty of videos on YouTube with people projection mapping onto various buildings, and plenty of things (including childrens' toys) use touch sensors to make noises."
"Were I to work with this student, I would prefer to do something with the projection mapping. Obviously in the classroom/showcase setting we wouldn't be able to project onto anything like the great wall, but we could use the same idea on a smaller scale."
"Using their supposed knowledge of Arduino, I would assist them in using the data they proposed in getting through temperature in their first idea in order to create a program that reacts to the temperature of bodies within the area. The more people there are creating more heat in the proposed area (that people would stand in), would affect an animation's speed. The colder it gets and as it is left alone, the animation would slow down as if being frozen in time."
"If I was to work with this student, then I would suggest that we extend on the idea of making a arduino program that can sense the temperature and gives some sort of results."
"I would have this student's knowledge of Arduino assist me in getting together a system that plays a colored light when a person presses a button, but then also takes a picture of that person at that same time; thus creating a ""selfie"" filter that is created instantly like a photobooth. Another use for it is we could do long exposure photos, and the user could press certain lights to light the picture before drawing with their LED."
"If I was to work with this student, then I would recommend that we create a system that tracks hand movements but instead of a RC car or plane, we would use a simple robot."
"I had a bit of difficulty understanding the third idea, but overall I felt that Tammy explained her ideas well. 
 
 
 
 1.In a week, Tammy would brainstorm, collect data, create a virtual and a paper prototype, and gather information from users and experts regarding her project. 
 
 2.Tammy would create a therapy program for children with special needs. She would use her resources to hire experts in related fields, and try to create the best program possible. 
 
 3.Tammy would create a mechanism that would record neurological feedback, and heart rate, when a user is exposed to certain stimuli."
"If me and this student were assigned to work on a project I think that both of us would have to come to a compromise since I am not skilled in the area that the student is speaking of doing a project on. I believe that the second idea that the student spoke on is a project that we could actually work on together, and we could also combine aspects of the first and third idea together to make a really cool project."
"This seems rather hardware-focused for the semester, while my skills focus on software. I'd be able to make it into more of an active, functional robot, perhaps as a way to simulate how the human body would move and react to various factors."
"Since it's one idea this is easy! For a semester, to have us actually work on, we would definitely need some scaling back. As far as a sort of machine to measure brain waves, I have no idea how to use it, or where to get one. This poses a big problem for us. As far as something for the heart, this might be a little difficult too. I'm not sure if you want an actual heart sensor, and what you need it for. They do have pulse sensors (http://goo.gl/7kFhfY) that you can use to measure heart rate, and are used by putting the sensor at either your fingertip or your earlobe. The people that created the sensor have a newer version of their product, which may be a better source of a pulse. 
 
 
 
 With all this, I'm not sure what you would want to accomplish. I'm not an expert on psychological aspects, so I'm not sure what would come out of having these strapped to a person, especially just for the heart sensor. You can tell when someone maybe is scared or something, but as far as getting that data and making something out of it, I have no idea. Especially because you want something that helps special needs children get better treatment I guess?"
The only idea that you had was finishing up the mobile mouse case and it seems like your are really focused on getting this prototype finish I would like to collaborate on this product to get this finish if we had to work together.
"It sounds as if you have one solid idea. Could you elaborate a little more on it? You call it your mobile mouse case, so what exactly makes it specialized?"
"I'm pretty sure I couldn't contribute very much. By the sound of it, this student has a pretty good grasp on what they plan on doing. However if they were accepting help I might be able to help craft the project. I spent a year in industrial design crafting prototypes and I might be able to lend a hand in the actual making of this product."
I would team up with this person and try to figure out a way to record and add video clips into a short loop composition that could be layered similar to how audio can be recorded and looped. I could just have certain opacities when I record 3-4 different clips and it would create something different and new every time to project.
"If we were to work in a group, I would try to blend the ideas of a digital physical system, the app, and the internet infrastructure to somehow create some sort of interconnected environment that is connected to all and is controlled by the phone app. This could be used to interact with others within the environment to do whatever the user wants. For example, if someone walks into the environment, I could trigger a device to turn on from my app on the phone."
"Their ideas are far too vague, I can't really start to picture what they had in their mind from this limited explanation. I am not too sure they too this assignment with the utmost sincerity. That being said, the general idea of what they wish to accomplish is quite clear due to its concentration of words. However, many questions about their ideas exist. Why do we need a new internet infrastructure? What type of game/app do you want to develop? What type of installation do you wish to build, and with what tools?
 
 
 
 Their ideas: 
 
 
 
 One Week: A small digital installation that has physical elements to it.
 
 
 
 Unlimited Time and Money: To create a new infrastructure for the internet that allows for everyone to be connected using solar/kinetic power as its power source.
 
 
 
 Realistic Semester: To create an interactive mobile game."
"Maybe you could mix your first and third idea for a mobile application that interacts with your physical installation. People could download the app and answer a few questions (like what did you eat for breakfast?) and when they arrived at the installation you could scan for their device, pull their questionnaire, and projection map objects that correspond to them (like waffles if that's what they had for breakfast). The beauty of it would be that other participants in the installation would not know that you were to the one would had waffles, so it would provide a level of voyeurism to each of the participants allowing them to look into someones life without not who they were looking at."
The app is a great idea because as far I know there are none out there for motorcyclist enthusiasts. For the project you could even combine the idea of graphics for motorcycles and use the app to share cool projects that people may be working on or want to collaborate on.
"I think the student put in effort but the ideas are still very vague for idea 2 and 3.
 
 
 
 Idea 1 - The idea mentioned painting the body of his motorcycle.
 
 
 
 Idea 2 - The idea mentioned creating a project that would make people more physically active. How would you go about promoting that? What motive would people have to jog instead of drive somewhere (especially when your destination is very far away)?
 
 
 
 Idea 3 - The idea mentioned creating a social media app for motorcycle riders. Need more information on what this app does, what software/programming language you are using, etc."
"Combining these ideas is somewhat tricky, since they seem to conflict with one another. On one side, you are trying to persuade people to be more physically active, but on the other side, there seems to be a big interest in motorcycling. If I had to extend on one of your ideas though, I'd maybe incorporate features to your social media app that not only talk about motorcycles, but also inform the public about being more physically active."
"I mentioned designing an Arcology when referencing your second idea (making people more active). Maybe we could work that into your project this semester. Obviously you could not make such a structure in a semester, however maybe you could draw up some blueprints for it. You could design it so that people would not have to use cars to get anywhere with everywhere being accessible by walking or elevators. You could look up how to make a self sufficient Arcology and try to incorporate that into your blueprints, was well as where you would place emergency services, housing, commercial, and schools."
"I think that we could really collaborating on something here. For one, I love print design and working in Illustrator to create fun graphics, so I think we would be able to collaborate on motorcycle designs to possibly sell! 
 
 
 
 I also believe we could make an awesome animation for a health PSA, since I would want to do an animation for my answers last week, and they want do get the word out for people to be healthier, we could collaborate and make a really fun animated PSA about it, and with the money given to us, that we would be able to use it for advertising and getting celebrity endorsements."
"I think that you have some good ideas. I really liked the first idea that you came up with it sounds as if you have put some thought into it. As for your second idea, would it be possible to empower these communities with a simplified version of your plan. When I think of the struggles that these communities have to deal with, my first notion is not that they are in need of jobs. Couldn't you help provide these communities with the means of acquiring power without setting up a full on power plant? Is there a cheaper, more dispensable means of creating a power generating device for these communities? Much like the paper water filter book, could you develop something that could provide usable energy at a low cost?"
"The three ideas were creating a short film that can inspire and also intrigue an audience, help make the world a better/happier place without the use a pharmaceutical drugs, and to learn more of the side of engineering and development. Some of the answers were pretty vague, like what type of film do you think would be inspirational, what type of audience or culture would you like to base it off of or target the film to? What do YOU think can make the world happier? Just try to expand more on these ideas and it would help."
"Your film idea is kind of vague. Inspirational can be so many things to so many people, you might want to focus on a specific topic over everything else. For your second idea, a ton of research would need to be made. You said you'd like to make the world happy with out the use of pharmaceutical drugs which makes me think you're also trying to have something that will help fight depression, not just boredom or sadness. A thing to keep in mind is that the brain holds onto more negative thoughts than positive. The third idea almost sounds like you'd like to know more about developing a program? I'm not really sure what you'd want to accomplish, but you should look for a group that is well rounded, and pay attention to your developers."
"I like the idea about making people happy and I know there is someone else who would like to do something similar to that in this class. What I think I would do first with this idea is to set a specific group (like college students around campus) and just go out and start interviewing. If you have a set list of questions its easy to just go up to someone and ask for some input. The good thing about starting on campus is that there are so many students from all different backgrounds, you'll start to get that wide variety of research you're looking for."
"I really would love to go off of the whole making people happy thing, but again, emotions are very subjective. Unless we actually had something that is proven to effectively make different people happy each time they use this product, it wouldn't work well. I mean, we could take a survey of everyone in DC and ask them what they think is funny, or what makes them happy, and you can make a short film on it?"
"So the second idea is definitely not in reach for a semester. You could combine the first and third ideas though. Obviously a short film would have some sort of sound, but maybe you could make a short film documenting how much you learn about music?"
"It was little hard to imagine what project would be. However, I agree with a week would be short week to develop a project. Also, some project could not make with unlimited fund and short time. I think you are good visualist and if you collaborate with other designers such as sound, media installation, and animator, it would be great project during this semester. Moreover, you can make plant to connect these three ideas that visual, clean water or self driving system, and music stuff. These are would be great project to interective each system to make human life better."
Maybe something with iterative video? Take video of people wanting previous participants and do some sort of synthesis using the similarities (or differences).
"To be honest, pretty sure I'm not on this person's level, neither thinking, or actual like tinkering. Obviously you could blend the first and the third projects because you mention an installation, lights, and robotics. I'm not sure how interactive the third idea is, but maybe instead of a camera looking at the hanging LEDs from below, it can look at it from above and have people walk under the lights? This way like if someone is walking and the lights are hanging too low, you can move them up with the pulley system you were mentioning. And use a Kinect to measure distance."
"The third idea has a lot to work with, so I would like to extend that into a large art piece that can be placed at a water show or a museum of machines. I think it would be interesting to see the inner working, like cables and light connections, to give the display some flair too."
"I know nothing about music and theater, but maybe with my sculpture skills we could design a set. Although the set would be here in Tempe, it could reference South Korean theater and draw attention to the South Korean theater community both here and abroad."
"All of the ideas have to do with either graphic novels or cartoons, so why not create a connection. Make a book that has the cartoon within it. Create a book, then put a screen within it, and instead of having a regular graphic novel, the cartoon appears."
"Perhaps a more augmented graphic novel, with thick ""pages"" for sensors and actuators, so we could provide sound effects (using tiny speakers) and some motion (motors under paper). Like the pop-up book of the future."
3D animation and psychology. Maybe a project that uses animation to help some sort of psychological disorder?
I would collaborate with this student to create real stimulating sound for the virtual world idea. One of the most important parts of our experience and reality is the 5 senses. I would want to make sure the sound design is perfectly matched to how it is in reality.
"I think that this student and I could work very well together. My background is in computers and computer programming as well, I think we could take the smaller idea as is and make it into a full blown project."
"All of your ideas seem to be based around developing some sort of game or program. It isn't that I don't find these ideas interesting, however what other projects might you be open to? For example, with your second idea: Would you take it a step further and utilize the Oculus Rift headset?"
"I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to offer you much assistance with your project. Although I have some experience developing games and programming, I have a very limited knowledge on the subject. However if you needed somebody to help craft something or to help develop character designs, I could be the man for the job."
If me and this student were assigned to collaborate together for the semester I would like to explore the possibilities of the students' last idea that involved a new way of playing video games with the cube that involves the first idea and some elements of the second idea.
"It is very apparent that this person to the time and effort to sincerely answer all three idea questions. They go into detail on what they exactly want to accomplish as well as what tools they would like to use for their project. I could very easily get a picture in my head for each of their three concepts and thus believe they explained their points clearly and concisely.
 
 
 
 Their ideas: 
 
 
 
 One Week: They wish to using projection mapping for either an art gallery or to show off their own line of clothing. They would use Max msp to facilitate the projection mapping and would plan on using video.
 
 
 
 Unlimited Time and Money: The wish to create a digital environment projection mapped into a room that children in hospitals and explore and play with using their hands or feet instead of controllers.
 
 
 
 Realistic Semester: A cube that would not allow the transgression of video game screen looking to cheat when planing with friends. This cube will have each player's perspective projection mapped on a different face making nigh impossible to catch a glimpse of what your friend in doing."
"I think your anti screen looking project idea is amazing, too often I have caught my younger brother committing this cardinal video game sin. The cube was a great idea, ignoring the top and bottom of the cube you have 4 surfaces and with video games often offering 4 player co-op you can projection map on each of the sides. you can make the cube sort of a furniture piece, coming with chairs (maybe cubes as well), and a way to easily store it+its projectors. I can not help you on the lines of knowing Max, but I think you should think ahead a bit to on how you could market such an awesome device/piece of furniture. The cube look could work as a ""futuristic"" vibe and that alone could be enough to get people interested. You could also make it so that it could be installed in arcades or bars allowing people to play games with friends or strangers."
"My way-far-out-you-are-insane addition: let's make a completely projected room from the outside-in, possibly using something like four white cloth sheets and project a 3D space from outside and possibly add some sort of motion tracking mechanism with objects or the people.
 
 
 
 My bound-to-earth proposal: yeah, let's do that."
"You have a good grasp on what you'd like to do. As long as you're comfortable with projection mapping I believe that all of your ideas will work. I'm not exactly sure what you would do with the art gallery, but if you've made some pieces of you're own you could make them pop using the projection. I also like that you're thinking of working with kids. You can do a lot with the idea of making an interactive environment around them, and even make it so that they can visit different places around the world from their own bed. The only thing I'm concerned about with the xbox is the split screen projection mapping. You might have to work with 2 different projectors."
I'd want to work more with your clothing brand idea. If you have some physical objects that people could model you could take video of that and then build a runway like stage to make an infinite runway. Along it you could use projection mapping on some mannequins along the way so that people can look at what you have.
"I do not think that I could help out with project 1 in much of a way as I do not have any carving experience, but possibly I could assist in the formation of ideas 2 or 3. The ideation seems pretty confident with project three so I think I could only assist in the actual physical construction of the installation, it doesn't seem like there would be much software involved. In idea 3 I could possibly help in the ideation process and define a solid idea of what the implemented project actually will be."
The idea about creating the frame sounds very unique. I would like to see something like that.
"This student can definitely go different ways into what type of project he or she wants to do. However, I think that maybe he or she should stick to some sort of project that has to do with geometry or coding or both."
"If I was to work with this student, then I would suggest focusing on a geometry oriented project."
"I'm not really sure how I could tie these together honestly. The ideas are very different, but maybe I'm just not thinking outside the box enough. However, I am thinking that maybe you could just smash all the ideas together, creating the installation with the sculpture instead of the light and it allows people to feel what others are feeling. I'm not really sure though."
"I'm not sure exactly what we could work on, but it seems like we both have similar interests based on the responses (Twitch, gaming, time travel) so the ideas would definitely be alike."
"The interactive system featuring the mermaid and the inverse of Twitch Plays Pokemon seem like two appealing ideas that can be blended. I am thinking that the project could be an installation of tv and projector such that a video game console is hooked up to a tv, which has a projection mapping of a mermaid on the screen. Whatever button a user presses on their console, the button can affect the mermaid's behaviors."
I think we could take the last one and turn it into a project this semester. The equipment is already easily available and it wouldn't be much of a stretch to bring this project to life with the correct sensors and programming.
"I think that the mermaid tank idea is really interesting, though it would likely be rather difficult. Making a prototype of this however could be feasible in a semester or two, where a smaller or simpler object or the skeleton of the mermaid model could be mapped into a special fish tank."
"As a game developer and programmer, I would be able to work with this student to create a game, given their lack of experience in programming. However, 'create a game' is incredibly broad, as games vary greatly based on their genre and theme, so it's difficult to lay out what type of game we would make; I would need to know more about this student's interests and what their goal is for the game."
"You'd like to make a stand to reduce the clutter of electronics. The problem with it is that there is stuff already kind of like that, and organizers already made. If you do make it so that its all contained with in the nightstand it could be really neat and even marketable. 
 
 
 
 For your second idea I think solar energy would be your best bet because I'm not sure of how you could take energy from the body and transfer it into a battery. With this idea, any article of clothing could be used for quick energy which would be pretty neat. The big problem I see is the lack of comfort from the clothing that you might get with attaching batteries and other things. People probably won't want to wear it if it's uncomfortable, especially if its hot. 
 
 
 
 The third Idea seems to be thought out, but I'm not sure what your concept is for the game. If you're good with animation you might be able to make a trailer that would spark interest for programmers. I think the biggest part before moving onto working with the occulus rift is to find that group to make your trailer and create a small part of the game."
"I like the idea of a hat or shirt that gathers electricity and i would want to branch off more on that, more because I'm not really sure about you're game idea, but I'd also like to learn more about it. As for the clothing, I think a big thing is focusing on the overall design of the clothing, to make sure that people would wear them. I also think development of a solar battery would need to go into the shits/hats/pants as well. Things to consider is if they need to be connected to the shirt at all times, how heavy they would be, and if the article are machine washable."
I think part of his third idea would likely be a good choice for a semester/year long project. A group of people would definitely be able to create a virtual world using Unity to create a simple first person shooter. This project could possibly be taken even further depending on the time and try to incorporate the coding needed to make this game usable with the Oculus Rift.
"I would try to help this student get more specific on there goals.
 
 What is the end result?
 
 How would you want people to feel?
 
 What would the sculpture be or do?"
"The ideas here aren't too fleshed out, but you've already begun to think about what things you would want in order to make something. Consider finding the limits of the technology, and go down from there."
I think it would be feasible to build something like an interactive sculpture using sensors and computers to do the calculations and alter the sculpture.
"The student put in a lot of time and effort into his/her ideas. Although these ideas are very detailed with what the student wants accomplished in the end, ideas 2 and 3 need more information as to what exactly Digital Culture students would be doing during the semester/year to apply their skills, aka, the ""engage and make it fun"" and ""find a way to expand"" needs work. I do understand the overall goal but this needs more explanation as to what a group of 4 students would be doing exactly.
 
 
 
 Reiteration of ideas:
 
 Idea 1 - Complete composition of two songs for cinematic, game, or advertisement.
 
 Idea 2 - Create campus ministries in all of the universities in America to establish relationships with the campus and business in the respective state.
 
 Idea 3 - Build partnerships with organizations and expand The Respect Movement to other campuses."
"Since your first idea seems to show an interest in creating music, I think you could tie this in with ideas 2 and 3. As an example, use the semester to create a song, maybe even a music video, to promote ideas 2 and 3. This music video could use projectors, cameras, and software that the digital culture has available to students."
"Your idea is very deeply thought out. Religion is an important aspect in an individual's life and it can help one out through college experience. I know the feeling of being wanting to fit into a group or service that you are interested and passion about. Your project seems very interesting, not everyone will agree to religion but they will agree to a community build upon passion"
This person made a sincere effort to express their ideas. This persons ideas were about creating clubs and organizations to help teach respect and other important things to our ASU students. These are some awesome ideas but I would try and leave religion out of it.
I am not at all that religious but I would do my best to help set up these clubs and organizations. If they need an app or something I could help out and mix my idea into it but other than that I just don't see us collaborating.
"The person has definitely thought of what they wanted to do. Although, I'm honestly not sure how exactly it would tie into digital culture. I do see potential in it though. Maybe some more thought about what digital culture is about, then try and make something that ties directly to that idea.
 
 The first idea is to basically make a song for someone.
 
 The second idea is to create an organization kinda like the Newman Center but better.
 
 The third idea is to become more connected with other campuses to create a more equal culture."
"I think that maybe we could tie in the songs with individuals and their need for equality. I guess what I am saying is that we could make an installation that scans someones face, then according to their structure or facial expression, it would create a song for that person."
"Not sure if the second idea is really for the billion dollars if not simply use $100 and get away with $999'999,900 at hand, but hey, honestly I would like some of that cheddar too. But I digress:
 
 
 
 This person has obvious interests in using projection mapping as a central thematic and makes absolute sense. Except, again, for the eyebrow-raising budget of a billion dollars for a simple project like that."
"I am intrigued by the project on the third bullet, only thing that keeps me wondering how well it would work is just the movement part because part of the illusion of space involvements like this is kinesthesic activity.
 
 
 
 SO!
 
 
 
 Introducing Virtuix Omni: a treadmill specifically designed of VR movement. http://www.virtuix.com/
 
 
 
 Perhaps using this could help with the production, albeit I am not sure if it would work way much better using Oculus Rift as well, which might just ruin the point of creating a projected environment outside.
 
 
 
 But I digress, I can sense something brewing."
"I would like to go with the immersive environment animation because it coordinates well with my idea of make an immersive environment for sick children in a Child's Hospital. I feel if we made an animation sequence that can give the children a sense of POV of the character on their journey, that could greatly be helpful for them. Since most of the children do not have access to such adventures, we could make an immersive environment that can give them a sense of adventure. Also incorporate the clothing onto the child so say the child is a knight on a quest, the immersive environment would be projected onto the surrounded and a knight's outfit or armor can be projected onto the clothing of the child to really give them the POV of the character."
I would help this artist to consider the time involved in animating because they would be making two animations which is going to eat up some time especially if they want to work in 3D. I would also hope they had some ideas on what the character looked like or the environment they character would be in because I would want to get started on the animations as soon as possible.
"Your ideas reminded me of the LifeStraw (http://www.buylifestraw.com/). This technology allows people around the world to filter contaminated water and allow it to be instantly drinkable through a straw. I think in a semester or two, a group of students could take a LifeStraw, and build on it even more somehow. Maybe use the same technology to where, instead of drinking from a straw, make a fast and easy way to clean and store this water instead for later usage."
I very much enjoy the idea of the rain water collecting building. We take for granted of the water supply we get in America even though some part of the country is hurting from trouts and lack of water. For an idea that gather rain water for usage is a pretty good idea. The facility can be build in an area that is rich with rain during certain time of the year like Florida or Washington. If you can collect the water then filter and a way to distribute it it would be really helpful.
"This student has some great ideas, especially the studio idea. I would use my skills in web-development and programming to help out in any way I could to get a studio going."
"There is a lot of excess verbiage; it sounds like an ad for Pottermore. Your description needs to show more objectiveness, like someone just talking about it not someone excitedly looking forward to it."
"You have a lot of examples in your entry. If you remove those and just show a variety of blogs types, styles and topics and maybe a blog 101 that would work better."
"I do not think the history of writing or the technology based readers is needed nor are the steps technology has made in computers. They make no difference to the system you are discussing. 
 
 I think if you keep your description to factual based reporting of the systems it will work better in the guide."
There is a lot of information there. Reddit appears to be an ever expanding source of information. If this is so then it meets the challenge like the blog.
"Describing the lenticular printing process earlier in the summary might be helpful to the reader, allowing us to get a better mental image of what is being described without resorting Google to get a quick and dirty definition."
"I'm looking forward to seeing what kind of image you use for this post. Perhaps adding a link to the different types of posts you described (photo-centric, media, text, etc) to give the reader the chance to see how the site works would be helpful?"
"Excellent description of the features, functionality, and purpose of Pottermore website. I had heard of it before, but always considered it to be a stagnant wiki for the Potter 'verse. It was enlightening to know that Rowling continues to participate. I think your description of how this is part of the future of books was laid out well using this specific example."
"Repetition of ""lore"" in the summary. Consider using synonyms in the other places this word was used? Extra word in first sentence of section 3: ""While Pottermore is limited to <b>to</b> Harry Potter"". Awkward phrasing: ""or eventual silver screen"". Consider revising wording and encasing this section in parenthetical?"
"Consider adding html links to research citations and the 99% Invisible podcast. This line confused me: ""Pew Research reports that in the past 30 years the levels of individuals over the age of 18 who do not has doubled."" What are these people not doing? Consider revising wording to make this reference clear."
"I encountered several run-on sentences throughout the assignment. This made it difficult to follow the author's arguments. Consider revising and parsing arguments out into a more centralized format. Additionally, incorrect word usage (""is becoming more patience"", ""provides the reader to"", ""as oppose to a book"", etc) made it extremely difficult to assimilate the author's meaning."
"Having no idea what an ""augmented reality reading experience"" is, your summary only confused me! Maybe somehow include in that initial summary that this product's purpose is to deliver a 3D reading and viewing experience. That is the point of this technology, correct?
 
 
 
 Also, the following sentence is confusing: ""At this time, it is an iPhone or iPad but there is an Android version under development."" I ran into many of these ""for instances"" and kept having to reread sections of your assignment. It was choppy to me and a hard read. There are numerous run on sentences and a plethora of facts but not enough explanation.Perhaps my best advice to you, as someone who has never heard of such a technology, is to reread your assignment and pretend you're in my shoes.
 
 
 
 Good luck!"
"The only thing I can say could use a bit of revising would be that you kept repeating that this book is a compilation of many different people's thoughts. I felt while reading your assignment that you may have repeated this so many times in different ways to fill space and hit the required word counts. If this is true, it's unfortunate because you did a great job on this assignment. I'd omit some of these repetitive phrases in your final draft.
 
 
 
 I also noticed the misspelling of a word in the following sentence: ""What makes this book afuture book is that it doesnt have a single author. It is more like an interactive blog or news feed on an internet social media sight ([SITE]<--change to this spelling) that an actual book."""
"I disagree with you that the future of books will be audiobooks! That's besides the point though and a personal opinion, not a literary critique. In all, I think that you completed this assignment in a purposeful, meaningful manner.
 
 
 
 Perhaps the only critique I have is that maybe you could explain why audiobooks haven't already taken off (it's a media that's been around for quite some time) and expand on the idea of why now is the audiobook's perfect opportunity for a comeback."
"UNFORTUNATELY, I don't think that your assignment needs much revision. You did an excellent job of ""doing it right the first time"" and it is obvious that your sentences are thoughtful and calculated.
 
 
 
 If anything, maybe include the pottermore.com link in your summary?
 
 
 
 Great work. I'm looking forward to reading and ""critiquing"" your future assignments for this class!"
"The description falls short, not just in word count, but in its aim to make me want to go out and read this book immediately. Vegan or not, the book should make me want to see what makes it different, how it can be a ""future"" book. I think with a little more explanation, this description could stand out more. Figure out exactly what makes Emily special to the vegan cookbook world. How is she innovative? If it's not just a cookbook, explain why."
"This entry did not find a specific book, but instead wrote about a hypothetical one. The main challenge is to think of books creatively, but this does not pinpoint something that I can actually go out and see for myself. I would suggest trying to find a hybrid-type book, or at least something that could become hybrid very easily."
"By not giving a real example of such a book, this entry is not completed. While the exact book the author speaks of may not yet exist, an example should still be found, per the assignment. The author should find something that is similar so that I can at least see what they're talking about a little more clearly."
"Perhaps add more written examples in the middle section, creating an overall convincing entry."
"The only thing I think may have been too bold of a statement was when you said that ""film will always be more powerful than text"". I do think that this is a rather subjective statement, as many individuals absolutely become enchanted by and involved in a story when it is on page, because so much is left up to their own imagination. The voice and image of a character, the tone or the character's overall mood, the atmosphere of a building or of a place - and the beauty of written text, at least in fictional stories, is that my perception of a character will never match another's; yet, in a film, a character appears in a very straightforward way, with very little interpretation to the viewer. I think it very much depends on the genre, for one to say that film is more powerful than text. Of course, if a demonstration or learning technique needs to be taught, I can definitely see how film is the way to go. But as for me, I have always been more comfortable with text, as it is easy for me to segment, control, and become enveloped in a story. I guess my critique would be to clarify WHEN film is more powerful than text (as you did) instead of making a general statement that film is ALWAYS better, as many people may not feel this is true. But, other then this, I literally thought that what you wrote was perfect, and I think you posed wonderful points and thoughts - great job!"
"The only issue I see with your future book idea is that, unless actual books / stories are uploaded by Reddit users, one cant really become involved / pulled in to a fictional world or fantasy land. For many, books are a means of escape, and many book readers want to become involved in the lives of the characters, want to understand them and relate to them, fight for them or fight against them; also, many individuals who read also like the idea of an alternate world existing. For instance, I believe that this is why so many series, like Harry Potter, The Hunger Games, or The Lord of the Rings, were so huge  because there was another universe that readers could disappear into. 
 
 Im not saying that there is no possibility for things like this to exist on Reddit  but your post didnt really give the feeling that users post stories full of characters or alternate worlds. I think that, if you were to include that in the future, entire books and stories will be uploaded onto Reddit, that this is the way books may be read in the future. For instance, if you said something akin to the following,instead of authors publishing books through a publishing company, maybe they will publish their novels through websites such as Reddit, as so many individuals use this website, it would give the sense that books in general are moving in the direction of being completely online through such websites."
"I believe that the author should make sure to be more clear about the fact that you can use this book in more ways than just reading through pages. Although e-devices were mentioned, I was still confused as to whether or not this type of book would be hand-held, on an e-device, or both. How will the book be accessed on an e-device - from a website? Will it be purchased and downloaded instantaneously, or ordered? Will it have any software that must be installed onto an e-device? While the author said that this book would be available for e-devices, I feel it should be more explicitly stated that it can fluctuate between being an experience through page or through screen, both, or neither, because I am still unsure as to whether this book can be read in the way a traditional book is read, or if that is not the case at all. Other than this, this genre of future books sounds exciting!"
"For the most part, the article is solid, even if the ""Description"" section is a bit short.
 
 
 
 My only criticism is that the article seems to only give vague examples as the girth of interactive activities that are available on Pottermore. For example, fan fiction--it's described as a hub for it, what does Pottermore offer that other fanfiction hosting websites do not? How is fanfiction integrated with other areas of the website mentioned, if there is any at all? 
 
 
 
 Also, because Pottermore is an online entity, perhaps it would be helpful to include links?"
"While the links are certainly very helpful, the ""Description"" segment of the article seems to rely on them too much instead of making its own unique statement about what the app is and why the audience should be interested."
"The image provided doesn't seem to reflect the interactive nature of the website. Perhaps a screenshot of one of the activities described in the ""Description"" would be better?"
"It's a bit nitpicky, but ""I have selected"" is hardly necessary here. It would far more effectively to cut that out and stick with the basic summary of the work."
"Describing a specific blog, rather than just describing the medium in general, would probably be a better way of showcasing the nature of the blog. However, if the author chooses to continue with simply talking about blogs in general, linking to specific blogs and blogging platforms would be a good way to showcase the diversity mentioned here, rather than just assuring the audience that it exists."
"This is a reasonable example of the direction in which future books are heading, but as the author continues to develop the field guide, it may be interesting for the reader if some of the history of the comic book, particularly as it developed in Japan (Manga, Anime) and Korea (Manhwa) is provided, as well as some thoughts on where all of this may be going as we proceed through this century and beyond. For example, it would seem that this style of reading entertainment -- especially popular to young adults -- is well suited for eventual transformation into 3-D renderings, perhaps even holographic, at some point in the future. In addition, some reference and relevance to our course readings (if possible) would make for a stronger case in point."
"One area in which this entry may fall short (as is the case with my own entry) is that a specific work is not identified. It may be helpful if an example of something like this could be found and then used as a supporting basis for the remainder of the field guide. The implication that the technology of the book and of information in general is moving toward digital is, I think, a valid one, but I for one would like to learn a little more about the specific portions of DNA components that allow us to be able to track historical genetic data and what this technology could afford us in 50 or 100 years. Also, it's always a good idea (as I'm sure you know) if our academic writing can be supported by relevant citations that support our statements and speculations. As your entry thus far is merely a rough first cut (for all of us), this is probably already in your plans as you work toward a final version!"
"Since a good example has been found that demonstrates a current trend in the timeline of 'book technology' (past, present, and future), In working toward a final draft, the author should not forget to provide a back drop to Tumblr, perhaps by describing more about what lead to Yahoo's acquisition of this technology, provide some more details about Tumbler itself (images, descriptions), and to speculate on where this technology could be leading us and how it will impact the continuing evolution of the book. References to course readings would also be a plus, if applicable."
"As mentioned in other critiques, and as this idea continues to be refined, some thought should be spent on the possibility of describing the history of book technology and in providing suggestions for where our digital reading technology is taking us. To be sure, printed books have been a critical factor in the advancement of mankind, but I think it would be nice to read more about some of the differences between what some of us may have experienced as children and what amazing options are for the children of today. Extend this into the future, and the possibilities become quite exciting indeed!"
I would really think of new ways in which ebooks can change like the way the one described in the field guide did. Instead of assuming that mainly a transition from paper to electronic format is all that will happen. Fill your future factor section with more of what you think is a possibility of the ebook.
The only place I can see that it falls short is that this entry is not actually about a book or something intended to replace a book. It is about a set of applications that essentially act as peripherals to a book. Similar to the way that video game system accessories add capability to the existing system. It would also have been nice to have a some information about the platforms on which these applications are currently available.
"It is not made clear in the description if this resource can be used by someone reading the book for added effect to their reading experience or if it is simply intended that more condensed and interactive ebooks/websites will eventually replace books. I do not agree with the comment about ""the perfect book for the Twitter generation"". Such books and short versions of full-length texts already exist. An old example would be the novelization of the death of Superman and his eventual return. Roger Stern was tasked with novelizing the most popular comic book story arc in the history of the medium, titled ""The Death and Life of Superman"". It was so popular that DC Comics produced a more condensed novelization for younger readers, titled ""Superman: Doomsday and Beyond"" by Louise Simonson. Generally, readers go to books for a greater depth of information and storytelling, which they find immersive. It is usually film adaptations that go the more condensed route. I don't se how such an innovation could actually replace the modern book, until they provide the same level of information and storytelling, as well a similar practicality of use."
"The only suggestion I would have is to make mention of the millions of different types of podcasts are out there. There is truly a podcast for everybody. This would give readers a reason to seek out podcasts. I know a lot of people who are intimidated by them just because they don't understand what they are, or that there are podcasts out there that cater to their interests."
"I think this entry could spend a little less time describing less relevant things (i.e., the first paragraph of the second section) and focus instead on simply and succinctly describing some of the features of Ideo. It would be interesting to have a quick summary of the features offered by the Nelson, Coupland, and Alice concepts. This would allow for further exploration of the specific benefits of each feature as they relate to different potential readers."
"The only suggestion I might have is to focus a bit more on what makes this story special and different from anything we've ever read before, rather than on being so descriptive about the characters or parts of the story. I definitely do want to hear a little about the story line, but feel there is a little bit too much of it here. I want to learn about the characters' reasons for doing things by reading the web comic itself, rather than from a summary. But overall I think this entry makes an excellent case for ""Annarasumanara"" as a futuristic book!"
"Some quick grammar edits I noticed:
 
 Film is powerful, and ""showing"" something to a learner is much more relatable that ""explaining"" something to a learner. -- that needs to be than.
 
 Babies cry when their hungry or uncomfortable and are not capable of fending for themselves. --their needs to be they are or they're.
 
 
 
 ""Film will always be more powerful than text."" This is a huge statement, and I don't think this one film or field guide backs up this statement. Your paragraph after this begins to argue that watching something on a page would be somehow better than reading words on a page, but you don't explain why. Probably I got bristled by this just because I'm a huge reader--for me, text will always be more powerful than film. But I think it might be easier to stick to this specific film, and say why this film is more powerful as a movie than it would be in book form. It is so much easier to prove a smaller point than a larger one, and the length limits for this assignment were so limited the space is really restricted to make a larger point.
 
 
 
 Also, I love your idea of a future book, in the third part, but the instructions read to describe what makes this specific item a future book. So again, I would maybe draw back to the movie Babies and talk a bit more about what the future factor of this film is. I think you could even move the last paragraph of your summary down to that third part, and get into a bit more of the movie's documentary aspect in the middle part, an exploration of the documentary as 'book' in the middle section.
 
 
 
 Oh, also I believe you need a pic! Somewhere in there. There were so many amazing shots in that film, I'm sure you can find a great screenshot online. Or, I'm not sure if this is possible with html but I believe it is, I bet you could link the trailer here from Youtube and use that as your pic? That might give readers the best idea of the film."
"Some quick grammar fixes I noticed:
 
 ""two hundred years in the future to a world that is recognizable yet alien""--I don't think this is grammatically wrong, I'm not sure, but I feel like ""two hundred years into a future world that is recognizable yet alien"" might read a bit smoother? Totally up to you, of course, but I just wanted to throw it out there.
 
 ""Truly a novel that inspires the reader to at least acknowledge that sustainability and human equality is possible.""--This sentence doesn't have a subject, I think it might make more sense to say ""Lllewellyn has written a novel that truly inspires the reader to acknowledge that sustainability and human equality is, at the very least, possible,"" or something like that. That authors name has so many L's!
 
 
 
 I don't have too much other constructive feedback, I think your choice of novel and why it is a future book is so right on. I guess maybe your title could be a little more powerful, but that is me straining for some more feedback to give you, to be honest. I think you have room to add some more descriptors in there, which might hook the reader in a bit more and pull them down into your assignment--your summary is so intriguing, but your title doesn't match that. Maybe: ""News from Gardenia by Robert Llewellyn is a utopian science fiction novel created, in part, by its readers.""
 
 
 
 Also, I'm not sure the sentence where you say you feel disloyal saying it isn't from the future is very clear. The whole wording of this part has to be sort of awkward as we're talking about a ""future"" book, and so it is awkward to figure out how to take about that, but you are saying it is from the future, right? So maybe ""This is from the future because"" because you aren't saying it isn't from the future? Does that make sense?"
"I love your concept of the role playing book, and I do agree that this is already happen to an extent. I think it would help if you gave a specific book that this is already happening with, as I believe this was the assignment. 
 
 
 
 So here is where I know this is happening. James Frey's new book, I believe it is called EndGame, will include a mystery with hidden gold (?) I think and an app produced by Google, so people can solve the mystery, plan on the app, and solve the game. Here is a link: http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/comic-con-james-frey-introduce-719685
 
 
 
 Google Niantic labs makes Ingress, an interactive real world game which people have written many books about, where you are battling in the real world for I think access to power points or something?"
"I think you need to pick a single specific book or other media source in existence today (game, choose your own adventure book) and describe that. I'm sure there is something out there that fits your description.
 
 
 
 You mention Phantasy Star in your summary, so if you choose to focus on that, I think your title should explain Phantasy Star, your description should explain Phantasy Star, etc.
 
 
 
 I gave examples of the Role Playing Book above that I could think of off the top of my head but the book that has always reminded me of a Choose Your Own Adventure Novel is Italo Calvino's If on a winter's nite a traveler... so you may also want to check that one out? You don't choose your own path in it, but you, as the reader, are written into the book.
 
 
 
 Also, I think you could compare Choose Your Own Adventure Novels to hyperlinks on the internet. Really, when we browse the internet, we are choosing our own adventure with each click. Instead of flipping to a different page in the book, we are moving to a different web page online. But until you focus on a single item, I don't think this assignment is done correctly."
"Some of the other concepts presented are awesome and future-esque, but this is by far the most intensely future-esque concept presented! Very cool. I'm surprised I haven't heard about this more, as it sounds so revelatory.
 
 
 
 I think each of these concepts sounds so complicated, it might be easier to focus on just Alice at it was the one that caught your attention."
"I was so interested in this that I looked it up online, and it looks like you took some of your info and text ""The team looked at how digital and analog books currently are being read, shared and collected, as well as at trends, business models and consumer behavior within related fields."" straight from their website? Bummer. It is important not to do this, as you will for sure get in trouble for it. If you have any other cut/copied text in there, get it out of there because Prof. Finn said he would run this through plagiarism software and it will catch this.
 
 
 
 What you want to try to do is read the web page, think about the information and process it, but say it in a completely different way. Or if you still want to say it in exactly that way, you need to attribute it to the web page.
 
 
 
 I think this is a lot to write about, as it sounds sort of overwhelming and complicated as three different book-related technologies. To me, it would be more digestible to just approach it from Alice, since you said that was the more interesting one. That way, there may be less pressure to summarize so much of what the company is doing, and it might be easier to just explain the technology of Alice itself?"
"I think what I'm missing here, from the title down, is a clear and brief description of what augmented reality is or how it works. Are there glasses? What makes it different than how I use my iPhone or iPad now? The pictures become 3D when I look at my iPad? I point my iPad at a picture? Where is the picture, what do I point at the iPad, my eyes or the picture? I guess for the non-techie, that aspect lost me. Just a slower, more clear description of the process of reading in this augmented reality. I pick up my iPad, and then what happens? Is there text on the screen, or only pictures? 
 
 
 
 What are QR codes? I would leave that part out, and focus on explaining the process of reading this sort of book like you're talking to someone who only reads hardback novels, and has no idea about the tech world. Just walk them through the experience. I'm a fan of making things really simple.
 
 
 
 And for some reason your title shows up as ""Untitled 341,"" but then you have a subtitle? So I'm not sure what happened there, if that was a glitch in the system or something."
"I think that the entry fell short on providing more reasoning as to why it will be a future book, and I would suggest to explain more about it."
I think that this entry had good supporting information as to why it can be a future book. I think that the reader was convinced and maybe provide more information in proving the point of why it is the future book.
"I think that the entry did not fall short and that its was well written with enough information for the reader to be convince. The only feedback would be about the font, It was not the regular font which is New Times Roman, that should be changed."
I think that the entry did not fall short and the reader was convinced that the digital books and society adapting to modern technology will enhance the demand to want digital books. I think maybe explain his question at the end.
"First of all, there are certainly some typographical errors that are easily corrected, such as ""individuals over the age of 18 who do not has doubled."" I assume that is meant to read ""over the age of 18 who do not READ has doubled"". 
 
 I believe that this field guide would also benefit from more focus. Rather than focus on the technology of podcasts or audioblogging, I would like to see how a specific podcast functions and demonstrates the way forward. The author does mention one work, ""99% Invisible"", but it is given as an example of the form rather than being the focus of the field guide. 
 
 This follows in the ""Future Factor"" portion of the response. Rather than focus on how the podcast points the way to the future of books, the author instead digresses on an unrelated tangent. While it's certainly interesting information, thoughts on book distribution, government censorship, etc. don't seem to have a place in this particular assignment. 
 
 I believe the primary changes that need to be made are in organization. Focus on a single work, demonstrate how the form is superior (or at least the way forward) and finally why this constitutes the future of the book."
"I may be wrong in this assessment, but I believe that the ""description"" aspect of the assignment was to be less focused on the content of the novel and more on what makes the novel different from other novels. As the author notes, the content itself isn't unique in that sense. I would suggest refocusing the ""description"" on the process of the publication, rather than the content. That way, it would clear-up plenty of space in the ""Future Factor"" section to discuss how this process shows us a way forward in the future of the book."
"I'm not certain the author adequately explains the benefits of the ""lack of borders"". There is mention that ""the visual style of this story goes hand in hand with its format"" but not having read the work I'm not sure what this means, aesthetically. Likewise, ""it takes the act of reading a story and makes it almost into a film strip"" does not indicate why this is necessarily a positive development, or one that can be expanded to other works. 
 
 There is also some confusion that seems contradictory, such as ""some hosting sites have shrunk the pages down to a more ""normal"" size"", suggesting a traditional page layout, yet the author also says, ""it simply could not have been published in the old media"". A few lines clarifying this apparent contradiction would be helpful. 
 
 Overall, a focus on the effect of this borderless approach with this book, as well as ideas on how it could be beneficial in the future would be helpful."
"In this case, the author focuses on a technology, rather than a specific work. I believe that to properly fulfill the assignment, the guide should be refocused on a particular work that uses Tumblr as the medium, and use examples from that work to demonstrate how Tumblr is different from other mediums. While one author is mentioned as an example, the field guide would be stronger if it were focused on the work, rather than the technology."
"I have very few criticisms of this work. Perhaps it would be beneficial to distinguish between these sorts of websites and an ""ordinary"" website dedicated to a particular piece of fiction. For example, would the myriad of fan-made websites be considered a part of this expansion of the book, or would it be limited to author-run websites?"
"My only critiques are grammatical ones. In your summary you saidpeople can subscribe to as many different ones to follow and read each entry. You have a strong voice throughout your entry, however this sentence feels awkward and could be rearranged so I it feels more cohesive with the rest of the entry. 
 
 Then, in your description, when you saidto skydive out of a plain, plain should be plane. 
 
 Thats all I got :) great job!"
"My only critique is a grammatical one. In the description when you saidA animated and interactive telling of the books, a should be an. 
 
 Thats it :) great job!"
"Um...well...I really don't have much. What can I say, you did a great job. I guess you could give us a quick line describing what the story is about. I think that could make your description stronger."
"Your description was excellent, but I feel that your argument as to why this should be considered afuture book was lacking. To me it felt as if you were defending it against modern technology instead of embracing it as part of our future and where books are going. I think if you removed these sentences it might help alleviate that defensive stance:Scanimation books are impossible to recreate in digital format. If one was to do so, it would entirely devalue the retro novelty and simply exist as crude animation, like an animated gif.""
 
 
 
 Also, in your description, when you said11 Iconic Scenes from a Galax Far, Far Away¦ Galax should be Galaxy."
"Your summary is very unclear. Even in your description I wasn't entirely sure where you were headed. I didn't fully understand what your entry was about until I read the ""Future Factor"" section. Creating a clear summary and immediately describing what this ""Future Book"" actually is will strengthen your whole assignment tremendously."
"I thought the field draft was well written, however in terms of the book's future factor I would like to know more about why other books would follow suit. It is clearly stated what makes the book different now, but what makes it special enough to be the future for other books?"
I feel the student's entry for future factor could do without the first three sentences. The student could easily use more examples of how the podcast is increasingly popular and what advances it is already making as well as why it will be more popular later.
"When reading the future factor I would like to know more about why this type of format is a natural progression. Would certain people not find it tedious? It is true that it may be a richer experience for those who are willing to try, but in all honesty how many people are willing to work and read? We live in an age where easy access and fun at your fingertips is most popular. So what makes this book accessible and how will other books follow?"
"Perhaps the student could explain why it would be a good idea for Emily C. to have her work only accessible online. The student has done a great job explaining why it was savvy for Emil C. to use her online resources, but why not also publish in print? What about people who are still reading physical books and struggle with the digital age? How will authors like Emily C. ease the people drifting behind into the future of e-books and online videos?"
I think the references to Nelson and Coupland were unnecessary. I think Alice covered all your bases on this assignment.
"But will the blog replace the book? I see them co-existing as they do presently, but unless blogs progress in some way, I am not seeing the ""future book"" part."
Is the answer documentary films or a book with digital capabilities? You answered the assignment with two different forms. I would say stick with the latter and re-write #1 & #2.
"The persepective in section 2 confused me a little bit. It was almost more like a sales pitch or business case from the IDEO company than a field guide entry. I think the field guide entry should contain observations from an outside observer. I would remove the sense that the author has some sort of insight into the IDEO company motives for creating the programs and provide a more in-depth description of how the interface between the programs works.
 
 
 
 Section 3 could also use more objectivity. It reads like one who is partial to this particular program."
"My only criticism of this is that I would like the focus to be aimed more closely at the actual books hosted on Pottermore. The focus of the assignment should be specifically what constitutes the future of the book. The format of the books on Pottermore may be the way of the future. Maybe someday all books will be hosted on a centralized website, like libraries of the future, with interactive material being an expected requirement."
This entry falls short in providing an actual example. Describing all ebooks is too generic for a field guide. I would pick one and explain why the ebook is the future of books through the description of a particular example.
This entry falls short in providing an actual example of this particular hybrid ebook. I think a field guide should focus on one example and describe the execution in detail.
"I loved this entry. It is hard to come up with comments here; however, if I was to try to make an argument for the future factor of audio books I would cite the increase in handheld smart phone devices, blue tooth car interfaces, and other technological advancements which make audio books easier to consume.
 
 
 
 I would be very surprised if there wasn't readily available data regarding a correlation between increase in tablets and audio book popularity."
"This entry could focus a little bit more on the history of the book, and how e-readers fall into the development of the book. Furthermore, the author could touch on the ways in which people interact with e-readers today."
"The description section could be a little bit longer. After reading it, I was still wanted to know more. I would also discuss the history of children's book, and how they have progressed briefly that way there is a comparison with the future."
"This entry could delve into the history of the book, and how this is represents the future of the book. The assignment called for what happens in 1000 to 5000 years, so perhaps a more complete picture of what makes this ""futuristic"" is necessary."
"The summary of the book could be a little more specific. What formats are you talking about? The description section, while it is well-written, seems out of place for this assignment. The only futuristic thing about this book seems to be the plot line, until it is explained that it is a crowdsourced book. The author could speak a lot more to the futuristic elements of that, as oppose to a summary of the book."
"This entry could do more to find the futuristic nature of the book. Specifically, the line, ""This additional element of art makes the book futuristic as well,"" doesn't really make sense because art has been incorporated in books for thousands of years. What/how will we be living that makes this book so applicable to the future?"
"There are quite a few editing errors that need to be made throughout the draft. A close reading should catch them. Otherwise, this site sounds like an interesting website for those interested in the Harry Potter series."
"There are some minor editing errors that should be seen on a slow re-reading of the entry. Additionally, I was a little bit confused on the concept of scanimation. The author of the entry gives a comparison but I find myself still struggling to see the futuristic qualities of the book. The book sounds like it fits the bill to a futuristic book but also just sounds like a picture a book. Perhaps a little more explanation of scanimation would explain the book better."
"This entry does really great at explaining hybrid books and how they are a potential future book type. However, this wasn't the assignment. There isn't a clearly chosen book that is being described just an idea of a book type/genre."
The formatting is a little bit confusing. I could not tell if there were parts that were quotes from the actual links provided.
"This entry falls short in two ways. First is a summary and description. I was confused for almost all the post as to what reddit is. Even once I followed the link, I was unsure as to what exactly its function is. There needs to be a more concise explanation as to what it is.
 
 The second way is in its contempt of the book. There are people who will more than likely be offended by how callously the author has decided to write of the importance of books. Maybe by explaining why they think reddit will replace physical books and bookstores, the reader will have better insight as to why the thought is replacement versus growing alongside them."
This entry falls a bit short in the summary section. I think it might be the grammar in the first sentence that throws me a bit off as to what the actual product is. This is better described in the second section and there is a moment where the concept is clarified in my mind as a reader.
"This entry is not for something that I think everyone can relate to, nor is it something that I think everyone would be interested. I do believe that this is an example of a future book, but I think this entry falls short in every other aspect. I appreciate the fact that this is a more personal example, but I don't think it fits the assignment.
 
 
 
 I think that this can be improved by choosing a topic that everyone can relate to. This is a narrow topic of an example of a future book for one individual, but not for everyone. In this scenario I'm still seeing people having to go out and buy books instead of having easier access to them like ebooks."
"If anything, I felt like this could have used more detail in order to make it a little bit longer. The length and the voice of the entry didn't seem to go hand in hand. I felt the passion that was coming through in the writing, but then it ended before I wanted to."
"I really wanted to see pictures! I loved the description of the book itself, but I wanted to actually see something instead of just reading about the aesthetics of the book. Also, this definitely needs a more concrete title. The title seems as if this was submitted on accident or out of confusion. Also, please remove ""the subject of this entry"" because that is self-explanatory."
"I think a way to really improve this would be to include videos in this entry. This field guide is an online field guide, so it only makes sense to provide links to videos that would help show how documentaries will be the future of the book. 
 
 
 
 ""Take for example"" in the summary doesn't fit with the rest of the assignment, it is self-explanatory. Also, choose what you want your focus to be on- do you want it on ""Babies"" or on documentaries as a whole? If you choose to focus more on ""Babies"", then include it in your conclusion of how this is a future book. If you choose to focus on documentaries on a whole, then I would omit the reference to ""Babies"" and include clips from different documentaries to prove your point."
"Because the programs are very unique and many readers could be unfamiliar with their concepts I feel that the first two programs, Nelson and Coupland could have benefitted from an expanded description. I understand that the limited word space requires succinct phrasing, and the current descriptions do a fine job of describing the programs actual functions, but specific examples of something a reader could do while using the app (instead of just describing general functions) and how it would benefit the reader might have clarified the apps purpose and place in the future of the book, making the description a bit easier to understand, especially to those who are unfamiliar with the programs."
"While I like the ideas and direction of the ""future book"" entry, I think it would benefit from a slightly stronger focus on how this can shape the direction of books and readership. The author mentions that this idea could be applied to other books and other genres, it would be worth it to consider how one could do so, how could authors make the interaction for books uniquely individual like Rowling did, and what will that do for reading - will being able to participate in such and interactive and immersive world drastically change how people read? There are several interesting and unique applications this type of site has to books in the future and I think the analysis of the future section could benefit from some slightly deeper analysis to truly convince readers how this could change reading forever."
"I would really have liked to see the author expand the ""asthetics"" portion of the description section. The general descriptions of what users can accomplish on Pottermore is direct and well written, but I think those not familiar with the site would be more intrigued if the author were to mention what the site looks like, how its set up (use of the sorting hat and the house systems with quizzes and games, common rooms to interact with other users in, the easter eggs in the interactive sections of the novels etc). This set-up is part of the large appeal of Pottermore and is crucial to it's success as an interactive site, so I feel that some attention does need to be given to it's physical appearance and practical uses in the description section."
"While the description of the types of fonts and formats is well presented and well reasoned, if feel including more detail of just how the use of those tools effects the emotional response/connection to the work of the reader would have helped sell the appeal of this type of book more. By just focusing on the detailed and complex uses of the font and format (while informative, important and well done in the original post) the book can come off as daunting or confusing, which may work for some readers, but in general feels like a hard sell to get people interested. By incorporating how those techniques create a unique and intriguing experience for the reader however, and why that experience of House of Leaves is unique, people might be far more willing to go into the book with an open mind and spirit and not be turned off to the idea of this type of media in general."
"Unless I read the title of your subject, I would not have understood what you were necessarily writing about, I kept waiting to read which particularblog you were discussing, however, you were speaking generally about blogs as a whole. Possibly bring up an example of a blog group that you have found very useful or interesting so that the reader could be directed to those and they could experience what you are describing. You spoke of tragedies, possibly reference where you read about a child drowning or cancer that struck you so interesting that you mentioned it here."
"The weakness of your paper is that you started off strong regarding Emily C. however finished somewhat generic with discussing an entire realm of futuristic literature. I am conflicted here because I do feel that the information you stated was important (one of the strengths I listed above) yet, I think you should find a more solid connection with Emilys journey. You mentioned that she was not associated with a publishing company, did she attempt to be published? Was publication a more difficult choice to spreading her story than e-book? I believe the convenience of publication online could be discussed, wherein that is also important to why she most likely decided to go this route, publishing a book is a confusing and long journey, yet the instantpublishing online does the job; thus the reason for so many disappearing bookstores."
"The weakness of your article would be several grammatical errors, however I understood and followed what you were saying with no problem. I think your article could have had more bearing if you described one particular hybrid book."
"The strengths of your Rough Draft are that you explained thoroughly an internet news community to where I did look it up, I had never heard of it before. The problem with the claim that this is ""already the future of the internet"" is that there are so many communities of information, it is sometimes difficult to decipher which carries the most accurate information. However, you could be very right, all the information we now receive is from sources that are not well known, and are put on by anyone, so that is accurate. You did a great job of striking my interest, so, as I said, I did look up your source and I will definitely look at it again for some information."
"The only thing that I would offer as a grammatical change is to not begin a paragraph with the word ""it"". Everything was wonderful as far else as I could see. The entire assignment flowed very well and was interesting."
The motion matches the description from everything that I can see. However I believe we were told to come up with some sort of description that was more story-related. In this case maybe the walker is a person with paranoia who runs when he thinks something is coming after him. Otherwise this sketch does what it is described and I love the screen wrapping.
Motion depicts the description ! running period can be increased to make it distinct.the difference between walking and running will be more noticeable apart from color change.
"The description does match the behavior, but I find it hard to see it as a rocket. When the rocket teleports back the bottom and changes color it seems like it is a separate object. If the the rocket were to bounce of the walls I think the piece would make more sense."
"Yes, the motion matches the description. The rectangle moves but stays within a confined area at the center of the screen. After a period of time it begins to move randomly outside of that area. The color changes from a light to dark red while trapped, then from a light to dark cyan when free. It could have been programmed to continue walking randomly on an infinite loop once free, instead of stopping or moving outside the screen."
"The motion does match the description, but the description seems a little vague. It does speed up and slow down like the author describes. The animation is also a bit boring to look at. Don't be afraid to add color."
It seems match the description. I can see both the rotation and the moving of the walker. But I'd like to see which kind of character does this walker looks like.
"The actions of the walker are described well, my only suggestion is when the walker goes off screen have it come through the other sider and not towards the middle."
"it does. What I would change about it, though, is that I would reset the squares on random points of the width as well. This is because when life sets you back, it can either be a little or a lot. Also because after a while, one side of the screen is left blank, making it look kind of lopsided. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 P.S. When I played it at first, it shaped out would looked like a running fox with a flaming tail. Thought that was cool."
"Umm, how does that describe the behavior of the walker object? This isn't supposed to be an artists statement but a description of the behavior of your walker object by using some behavior that is found in the natural world or described through a character of some kind. The Sporadic adjective does kinda work since the movement seems random, but I would really try to make your object link to something in life besides a square."
"I do not believe the motion matches the description. Perhaps the speed needs to be decreased, it is not visible when the rectangle is standing still to save energy - there seems to always be movement. However, I do notice when the rectangle is moved 30 units away from a point."
"The sketch was quite unexpected. I had expected a large rectangle travelling down the screen and found one that was small and nearly transparent. However, I like how well it matches the actions of a parachute explorer. The response in question 2 matches the behavior of the rectangle as like that of the parachute explorer, giving me a better sense of what is happening on the screen."
"Simple and straight to the point, this patch was fun and easy to use. The primary sound was simple but slightly annoying (perhaps like a good 'no' sound should be. The surprise of the 'yay' when I found the yes key was extremely pleasing and the the fireworks certainly added a cool surprise."
"Simple structure but effective, the added graphics were great but unexpected because they had not come up in class as an option within the creative process of this software. Seems like I am learning a lot about what the possibilities for more user friendly interface design. My only critic was that the buttons at the bottom could have been lined up more symmetrically."
"The introduction of the header and master audio switch is a novel idea that is aesthetically pleasing and improves immensely the ease with which the viewer can control the program and use it correctly. The presence of the links between the different objects, necessary as they may be, slightly detract from the quality of the header and switch button. The actual working part of the program seems slightly clunky due to the zigzagging wires crossing through one another and the yes/no button signals. The organization of the patch elements and including more novel sounds will make the patch perfect."
"While I was using this patch, I was very confused by the good key and bad key sounds. The sound for the bad key element did not sound as negative as I would want it to be. The good key element, with the sound being a bell ringing, was a good choice for determining what the good key was but, the choice for the bad keys was questionable with it being just a simple drum hit."
"The patch is very simple to use, but overall not very user friendly. For example, in order for the patch to work the user must load the clips and then turn on the sound. Adding some comments would help the user know what to do. PS! Thanks for not using the most annoying failure sound!! A lot of other patches use really annoying failure sounds and, since you end up hearing it over and over it gets really annoying. So thanks for using something that's not horrible!"
"There is nothing technically wrong with the patch, however, the patch only needs one sound control, you don't need a second exdac object."
"It has a logical flow, but there are two ending speakers that it can lead to. This could have been simplified. There is only one comments, and it is not specific enough if the person is unfamiliar with the program."
"There are two ending speakers/end points. This could have been simplified to making it only one speaker. 
 
 
 
 They could have left in the comments what key number 100 is."
"No, while the assignment was very organized and clean, they didn't really do anything exciting. I didn't learn anything from it. They couldve added extra sounds to make it better."
"Simple coding like in class, nothing different other than the sound files and the correct key. The comments on the side somewhat gave away the correct key though. I mean, I know it was there for the coder's purpose but for someone who did not know and was trying to figure it out, I would have renamed the sound files to something more incognito as well as the comment."
I found the coding to be basically the same as shown in class. The two extra switches I thought maybe could have been removed. The sound was original as well.
"This patch is another short and simple patch but i feel like it needs more room to be able to see more clearly, since it is a short assignment it does not hurt to spread them out a bit more."
The program worked perfectly and it was interesting to hear different sounds and nothing repetitive. All they have to do is spread their projects out more in future projects.
"The patch was pretty standard in terms of technical setup. It followed the tutorial correctly. As mentioned above, the maniacal laugh was pretty surprising. I cant imagine what people with headphones might have done. The sounds chosen did get a bit annoying after multiple key presses, so using multiple laugh tracks might help with the monotony that tends to occur after multiple attempts. In the future I might suggest labeling your files with your name or some kind of identifier - especially if an instructor is going to be looking at it."
"I like the simple layout and the description used to navigate the user into understanding the patch and what it does. They approached it the same way we approached it in class whereas one key is good, and the other key is bad. They could have made more good keys."
"The whole thing was incredibly straightforward. I'd have preferred something a little more out of the box, particularly when we were given some degree of freedom. It works exactly how it was assigned, and I feel it's a little boring."
The patch was neat and organized. But a few of the pieces like the buttons didn't need to be there.
"It's a very simple lay out. Very bare bones, and minimalistic. No real explanations to what everything does, outside of the 'good' and 'bad' buttons, but the path to each part if pretty easy to figure out."
"There was some key hunting, and the 'no' sound, which was from Sonic, was a little grating to the ears after a while because of how loud it was being played. The 'yes' sound highly amused me, the victory sound from any given Final Fantasy game. It did feel like a victory after finally finding the 'good' key. It was a nice experience overall."
"Technically, it wasn't anything complicated, and nothing experimental about it. Because of how simple it was, I didn't learn anything new and nothing jumped out at me. Which is fine since the path to each part was laid out to where it should be. Maybe adding a level meter in just to give the user an idea of how loud everything is, and possibly making sure before using a sound that it's not too loud for the user. Other than that, it was a pretty good patch."
it was pretty simple only thing i would have done differently would be shortening the victory sound file
"The failure sound is really annoying, I suppose that it makes the user more motivated to find the success sound, but the game requires hearing the fail sound over and over. It would be better if it was a softer, shorter, less annoying sound, or had volume controls so I don't have to endure it."
"This patch is very simple and easy to understand, but it isn't very user friendly. Adding a few comments to tell the user to load the sample and turn on the sound, for example, would make the patch easier for the user."
"I learned how to select multiple keys/values using the select object, which was something I was trying to do when creating my patch, and for some reason I just couldn't get it to work. Despite my confusion, I think this person did a pretty good job on the assignment. They achieved something completely unique to what I have seen so far. My one suggestion would be to find clearer and possibly shorter sounds."
"Technically the patching looks fine. It looks like the assignment was followed exactly, the only thing I did not see was the meter. I did not see anything out of the norm in terms of a new feature or function that was not assigned. I really do like the visual aesthetics were very appealing. I did not learn anything new from the way the programming was completed. I think would could have possible been improved was just the recording sound of the wave files, they were just really low."
The overall feeling I got when looking at the patcher was that it was cleanly laid out. My personal preference would be to line up the edges of the bottom boxes with the edges the message patches above. A minor point!!!
"The coding assignment was formatted and completed the same way as it was done in class, but there was an additional sound meter added.
 
 
 
 They could have left comments such as what key number 97 is."
"It was approached in a different way than what the lecture taught, which is always welcome. What the creator could do is to explain the features of the patch so new users don't get lost on it."
"This is another bare bones basically and neatly structured patch. If they wanted to do more they could have used background colors, made the key a bit more difficult to find with key combinations, and other slightly more complicated additions to the game."
only thing i would change would be to get it to work by pressing keyboard buttons
"It was fairly straight forward so I did not learn anything new in the coding. I think to do this better the author could have added the select message to operate the program to make sound. I think the clarity was well accomplished, and in the future they can focus on being more technically intense."
"Coding system similar to that of class example, only difference was the sounds, maybe a few different sounds added in to the mix would have helped."
"The coding assignment was very similar to the screencast. The one exception being that they placed buttons before the 'open' messages. For someone who was unfamiliar with Max or any kind of code, I felt it enhanced the patch from a visual aesthetic and also let the user clearly see what the patch was doing. I think that this was where I was forced to wrap my mind around something. Some could argue that the buttons are unnecessary and it might have a pure simplicity without them."
"I think you did a good jobs, and also picked a really funny music. The most impressive thing in your project is a decibel meter to measure the sound, however I think that you might be able to do something more creative."
"Aside from the sounds and extra meter, I'd say this patch was pretty run of the mill. I didn't really see a use for the extra meter, but it did add a little extra visual component to the project. One thing I think could be improved is that there was a little extra length of ""noise"" at the end of the yes soundbite and that probably could have been trimmed off."
Looks like it could be tighter/organized slightly more.
One of the sounds was funny it made me chuckle but the no sound was a simple no which i would of preferred it to make another sound other than the obvious no or incorrect try again.
"They seemed to have decided to just stack the codes on top of each other which worked. I think comments would have made for a better experience, so I could test the patch quickly without having to google the right code. I would have added the comment boxes for faster testing."
"Seriously kind of aggrivated. I understand why the coding was so squished now, because the key to activate it was control and the v key. And no, I did not figure it out on my own, I looked it up because I was so annoyed I kept hearing high ho silver awaaaay. When I finally heard the correct sound I was a bit confused, but I guess it makes sense it was talking about teeth and having silver plates on them or else it could cause gingivitis? I don't know, didn't understand that joke.."
"Since it was condensed in size, it definitely took more time to find the right key(S), PLURAL. It was definitely surprising because I literally went down the rows of keys trying to match the numbers. I learned that to be sneaky and troll people, don't show all the connections so that people can get frustrated and slam their keyboard...no I didn't do that.."
"I would have liked more notes and the whole thing just seemed a little crammed together. There's space! Use it! There's also a number box with a -127, and I'm not sure why."
"So, the ASCII code for their selected value is 22, but that doesn't actually correspond to a keyboard input, so it didn't actually function in the way I would hope."
"The patch is very simple, but the creator could have added a few things to make it easier to the user. Firstly, comments that tell the user to turn on the sound, for example, would make is user friendly. Secondly, adding a few features like the ability to pick the ""success"" key would be a great feature for this patch."
Simple and not as developed as it could have been. On a positive note it was not intimidating.
"Basic concept, kind of monotonous and it took me while to find the 'yes' key! The redeeming factor was the 'yes' sound was crazy and strange and interesting which made it worth the wait."
Nothing new from what we did in class and they layout could have been a little tidier. May have been cool to add some graphics? A good reminder that we need to push our creativity if we want to come up with something truly original!
"There was a really cool and neat idea in the patch that somehow along the way didn't come through. I don't know if something had a wrong path, or something. I did see two message boxes before the speaker, so I don't know if that was the problem or not. The idea was exiting, but sadly I couldn't hear it."
This patch looked a little to clumped together. I think it would look more clear and professional if there was more space in between each of the keys. I also don't see the a button that explains the letter that represents the good key so I'm unsure which key to hit.
"This patcher followed all the right rules and components of this assignment. I still suggest spacing out the buttons/keys to look better and cleaner. In this case, I would also advise on stating which key is the good key for the sake of time for this critique assignment. But it still played the sounds and functioned perfectly."
The sounds are entertaining. It's a bit confusing that the sound is used for both good key and bad key. At first it made me think I had pressed both keys or there was an error in the way it was coded. I then realized the same sound is used within the good key sound as the bad key sound. It's very easy to use and navigate.
"Like I said before, it was done very simply. Which is always good. The simpler the better. However, I kinda would have liked to see comments of some sort. If I had no idea what was going on, I would be incredibly lost. Honestly, I didn't really learn anything new from this patch."
Before I ran the patch the overall look and feel was very confusing to me at first. I was unsure how it worked together. I have limited experience with Max and this may be my reason for my confusion but I do think it could be a little more cleaned up.
"I appreciate the fact that Tom tried to do something different with his project and expand upon what was taught in class, but I do think he could have organized it better and chosen sounds that aren't extremely similar to each other. There is just a lot going on in this patch and I think it should have been simplified."
I'd like it better if things were more organized. I have to look in many different parts of the display box to see what is what.
The sounds are simple and not very entertaining in my opinion. The good key is kind of exciting but runs a bit longer than I'd like it to. The experience I get is just wanting to press many different keys over and over
They approached it exactly as we did in the classroom. I didn't really learn anything from what they did because it's very similar to mine. I would at least organize the different objects.
Technically simple. I would have liked an overlap of sound that two speakers would have given the patch. It would have made it more fun to use.
"Like I said before, it is virtually identical to the example from class. I would suggest cleaning up the patch cords and organization of objects a little more."
