I think if you expanded on what you wanted your music playing device would do or even look/ sound like it would have stretched your thinking a bit more.
"If I was your partner Id suggest adding visuals to make it more of an installation. I am not much of a sound girl so I would like to come up with some visuals to add to your abstract music piece. Do the different sounds have to by programmed to keys or can we think of a more interesting way to ""play"". Or are the sounds you play the important part of your project? Is it strictly abstract or can there be a way for the user to express themselves having more control???"
"All three of the questions were answered, but, in my opinion, were a little vague. The answers stated pretty much what they wanted to do, but I didn't read very much thought being put into these answers. All questions are answered clearly, just not in a very detailed manner."
"On the first and third questions they had a pretty solid idea, but question two they failed to put really any effort or real thought into. The first idea could be fleshed out better in terms of how the physical presentation would look like as well as why their idea is important and what the goal of it is.
 
 
 
 1. A very simple midi keyboard program for a computer.
 
 2. Another ipod? 
 
 3. A program that reads color and turns it into music."
I think that the video game idea using lasers is possible to accomplish this semester. But maybe using a wii remote would work better than using the kinect since there may not be too much motion.
"The glove project is the most interesting project. It is hard to track person's hand moving, I know. But you can develop the idea further. For example, if you can use the glove to remote manipulate some objects. Or even an idea, but I think the introduction video will be awesome."
"These projects - a simple midi controller, soldier drones, and a video game glove - have all been proposed many times. We see these types of things all the time in movies, and occasionally in real life. It doesn't seem like the thinking was stretched very much, but that previous ideas were re-used."
"The virtual reality glove would require a lot of fine-tuning in order to make it complete, and although I don't have much experience with working on hardware, I would be able to work on the software end of the project. Rather than trying to replicate the exact feelings of the player moving their hand, I would shift towards a more game-oriented end goal by programming the glove to sense the user's reason for using their hand then acting accordingly (for example, a grasping hand motion would be registered as the user trying to grab something, which would then cause the user's avatar in the virtual world to grab something). This is more game-focused than the original idea, though it would be the same project overall."
"The ideas feel somewhat proposed as they are, though I'm left with many questions as to how something would be made or how complicated it would be. The first idea talks about skills more than what can be accomplished. It seems that this student is not entirely aware of what they can do with their skillset, specifically due to lack of programming knowledge. The second idea is understandable yet I'm not sure as to how this would take a large amount of money and time. It feels like setting up an incredibly large and intricate information system, then giving that information to the user in a simplified format. The third idea is clear though the student does not write about how something like that is feasible; I feel that it's less of a technical project on the student's end and would mostly require interacting with and convincing the performers and producers at the concert to let them hook up things for the app to work."
"I'd shift this student's third idea away from live concerts and more towards an app that could simulate what an actual concert might be like given some music, wherever they may be. It would consist of the same features and would focus more on the app's software than interacting with music that is currently playing, allowing users to play a song and change various settings to make it sound as if it was being played live. I would feel that it would be more feasible and more about the technical efforts than interacting with musicians themselves."
"I would say that ideas 2 and 3 are definitely more focused with and objective, however though I am impressed with idea 1, it explains more of what your skills are rather than an actual particular project such as ""make a video that does X"" or ""compose a song around X ideas"". I got confused at the beginning of 1 because you state that you could build a website but then later make note that you do not have much programming experience, so I am assuming this would be done by some other means like a template website designer and not actually using HTML and CSS."
"I like the idea of simplifying things like routes and safety in cycling. I think we could think up ways on how we could branch out with these ideas or even conjure up some more,"
"You have a great goal, to make cycling safer. If only you wrote down a few more ways to achieve this. A way to report dangers threw an app or something is a great idea. It would give cyclist a voice and push the city to make changes. What other ways can this be done?"
"1) A quick board/video game
 
 2) NCVR - Virtual Reality that is truly immersive (utilizing all senses)
 
 3) Creating an AI
 
 
 
 It seems like they really put some thought into it, as it all seems to build upon each other. However, the semester idea seems perhaps too ambitious."
"He/she has ideas about the game design are related human body and nervous system. His/her plans and ideas are related each other. Also, he/she has rough design concept and I think he/she has potential energy to develop and realize the system. That is not perfect yet, but it would be great project under his/her plans during this collaboration project. Also, his/her NCVR project is not far away from today."
"I can tell that this student is very passionate about virtual reality, as am I. This NCVR sounds like an excellent idea (albeit a little risky) but it would definitely be the next step in VR. Visuals have been covered by systems such as the Oculus Rift, but that's as far as it goes (to my knowledge)."
I think they thought about what they wanted to do. It was what seemed to be as much elaboration as needed for this type of assignment. It seemed like everything was more or less just an idea and there was nothing that had really been thought of.
"They actually seem to emit a sense of having a clear idea on their heads that may just be much easier to describe with pictures rather than words. i can see their vision, but not much of the whole concept yet."
"Although they made attempts and I think their ideas were in the right direction because the person wanted to tackle larger problems; however, they didn't propose workable ideas."
"I mean, they didn't really propose anything for the first idea. Technically, they answered the actual question to the fullest, because it asked ""what could you yourself accomplish in a week?"" They said that with one week to do something, they could get the planning phase done, and start to draw up concepts to actually get a finished product. There was no idea stated. For the second, they gave more of an idea of creating a way to make higher education accessible to all those who wish to further their learning, but beyond that there was nothing. The same goes for the third idea, there was not a specific idea to state, but rather that it would be better to work in a group to get stuff done."
"Literally, it's almost impossible to get something done with this students ideas, because there is nothing to go off of. The only thing to go off of would be that we would be coming together for one cause."
"I do not believe that this student took much time and getting this homework assignment or really tried. There isn't much to be able to think about here, and although buying convertibles for everyone sounds like a good idea, it doesn't have anything to do with our major or creating something from nothing."
There is nothing I can collaborate with another student on because they didn't write enough idea down for something to be created in a partnership.
"Idea 1: It is not really a full idea, but rather a general 'first steps to a larger project' outline.
 
 Idea 2: The idea is to assemble a team that can work to find a way to make a college education free for everyone, or to buy everyone a sports car should this team prove unsuccessful.
 
 Idea3: This is not really a full idea either, but it builds on the idea of assembling a team presented in Idea 2.
 
 
 
 While the specifics of the process this student would like use when starting to work on something are fleshed-out a bit, the specifics of what this student would like to do are only expressed in the Second idea concerning free college education. So it is a little vague."
"Ideas 1 and 3 do not have a definitive project idea and are more so how far along one could develop the stages of making an idea in that time, whereas 2 the idea is to find a way to make education free to individuals. In idea one the student states that they could outline and blueprint some rough ideas of what a final project may do, and plan the next stages to get there. In idea 3 the student states that they would recruit a team of individuals to develop a more cohesive project."
"I believe that the student made a sincere effort into their answers for ideas 1 and 2, and to a lesser extent idea 3. Idea 2 could have used some more clarification as I am not wholly sure what these group games are, while idea three could use some expanding upon.
 
 
 
 Their one week idea was to create a mini-game that tested the end users reaction time and post their ""score"" on an internet serve, thus allowing players to rank their times.If they were given no time or money limit they would want to construct a world fitness center that both explores the concept of group games that promote healthy fitness as well as having machines/other equipment that help the users stay fit. They are willing to offer prize incentives for working overtime. For their semester goal they wish they wish to be more involved in their gaming company and create several more games for a college student audience that help them with their class studies."
"This student did a great job at stretching their thinking. There are three ideas present, each with their own unique twist on them due to the limitations of either time or money. The first idea is a game, not sure what platform, that calculates reaction time of the user. It would be awesome to have further discussion on what this could be used for; personally, I see this mini-game being used for competition entertainment between friends. The second idea is a group of games used to encourage a healthy and fit lifestyle by using a reward benefactor to motivate people. The third idea touches briefly on the student's passion to expand their gaming company."
As far as the description of the idea goes it does hit some points. I like the idea of the game for fitness. I'm a little confused about it being an video games or an physical game like sports? I like how it would incorporate on the physical aspect of fitness like using gym equipments for the workout. The incentive on accumulating points is also a great idea. I picture this idea as in the Wii Fit game but not augmented reality? An example on this would be helpful for a visual example.
"The ideas here are fairly well-thought-out. None of these ideas are very detailed, but at this point, they have enough information that can see the thought put into the ideas."
"The first and third ideas - using hand-painted images for a wedding, etc. book, and educational games - have been done many times over. The second idea - changing the look of a building based on internal or external activity - seems like it could be done easily enough, and I don't know that it's been done before."
"I think I would want to scale down the second idea. Instead of changing the outside of a building, we could make a projection that alters image based on interaction of viewers in front of a sensor such as a kinect."
"I think the student has interesting ideas regarding the exploratory questions of this assignment, but needs to be more specific about their ideas in question 2 and 3. How would the display make the skyscraper building ""less standard""? What are the games that can be played outside of the classroom? 
 
 
 
 His/her three ideas are to create a wedding book of painted stock images, an interactive display of digital arts at the side of a skyscraper, and an educational video games based on a business idea."
"The first idea was a scanable storybook program, that simplifies and makes creating photo albums easy and simple. The second was to create a building that would react to people in, around, and people looking at the building, interacting visually with all of them. The third idea is video game education program, working inside schools and possibly outside. 
 
 
 
 The ideas were sincere but the last idea really could have been explained a bit more, all ideas are good. Especially the building idea, it really makes me wish that existed in a large scale."
"There are three good ideas present, however not all answers have deeply thought out ideas. I love the ideas but I wish the student would have expanded on their ideas. The first idea is to create a first person shooter game. I like the idea of creating a map/level that can be added to a first person shooter game. It would be awesome to have a game that allowed the game community and its aspiring developers be the creation factor of the maps, levels, and content. The second idea is to build a gaming team to create video games that raise discussion on important topics/issues in the world. These games will also keep the traditional aspect of what a game is. The third idea would be to create an exploration game."
"As the author mentions, he is a game level designer. So I am interesting in his game level design. It would be fun to explore the key of each level in order to reach the next level. But I have no idea about how to do that. Hope to see your game!"
"I think that you have a few good ideas about what you want to do, however I am a little unclear on both of them. 
 
 
 
 1) For the pistol device that you mentioned in idea 2: Why is it a designed to be pistol like? If you are worried about negligent or improper behavior in a community, why would you shape your device to look like a deadly weapon? Additionally, could you elaborate a little more on what you meant by patrol device? What makes it more or less specialized than a smart phone?
 
 
 
 2) For the mobile app: I too find it interesting to manipulate a mobile device to track social and personal habits. What kind of error proofing will you need to do in order to make sure the mobile app doesn't go off during every quiet situation? Also what kind of habits are you specifically attempting to track? The range of personal and social habits is a pretty broad range."
"The answer in the first idea is pretty vague. The writer seems more interested in putting down steps for developing an idea rather than actually conceptualizing a project. The second question is more thoroughly thought out and visualized, though there are some privacy and safety questions arising from the idea of a private autonomous, or at least mobile, surveillance system. The third idea is the most feasible, though I would fins it kind of irritating if my phone kept making personal comments about my habits and randomly playing music suddenly when it gets quiet."
They seemed to make a sincere effort and propose three things. The first being to just simply plan ahead as much as possible. The second was to create a non profit company organization that hires law enforcement that uses patrol devices. The third is to showcase a demo of the idea with a mobile app.
"I think this student really thought through what they could do with the time and resources with a project, and came up with some really interesting ideas."
"I'm not sure if the first one is something I would work on with this student, just because I like to create things that are used and help people. Although it's a cool idea, I'm not sure that music or sounds playing when you open the door or touch the handle are something that I would find interesting enough to help on. 
 
 
 
 However, I would definitely be able to help with the other two ideas. I think the mapping is a great idea, especially in a very cultural way. You would be able to discover things with the mapping that you wouldn't normally be able to unless you took a trip all the way there which takes time and money. 
 
 
 
 I would also be able to work on the last one, also possibly working on a fun animation PSA to spread across the country and the world and hopefully be able to get more individuals involved in saving the Earth's resources."
"Only two ideas were provided, but I did feel the classmate gave adequate descriptions of their ideas. 
 
 
 
 1.A project that involves touch and sound. When individuals touched a door handle, this action would trigger different sounds. 
 
 2.Large scale projection mapping. The project might involve projecting related historical videos on large historical monuments. The point of this project would be to give tourist the opportunity to learn about history when visiting historical sites.
 
 3.Classmate would like to work on a project that helps people."
The projection mapping project is of the most interest to me. I believe this project would be best accomplished by developing a large scale projector. I like the idea of helping to teach the general public about history in a new and exciting way.
"There is definitely some vague writing on the third idea - saying ""I don't know,"" but maybe doing some game - but the other two ideas - interactive touch sensors to trigger sound, and projection mapping onto landmarks - are less vague, but not all that original. There are plenty of videos on YouTube with people projection mapping onto various buildings, and plenty of things (including childrens' toys) use touch sensors to make noises."
"Were I to work with this student, I would prefer to do something with the projection mapping. Obviously in the classroom/showcase setting we wouldn't be able to project onto anything like the great wall, but we could use the same idea on a smaller scale."
"These seem like a person's scribbled notes, and took me a little bit to decipher. They didn't think the ideas all the way trough to the presentation, just the general idea of it. To me its hard to visualize something if they don't describe the physical parts or generally explain how they would get it done and why it differs from the average idea.
 
 1. A computer program thermometer
 
 2. 3D printing research
 
 3. Virtual joust?"
"Using their supposed knowledge of Arduino, I would assist them in using the data they proposed in getting through temperature in their first idea in order to create a program that reacts to the temperature of bodies within the area. The more people there are creating more heat in the proposed area (that people would stand in), would affect an animation's speed. The colder it gets and as it is left alone, the animation would slow down as if being frozen in time."
"This person gives a pretty clear idea of what he wants to create, but fails to explain the purpose of creating it. What would set it apart? Why make something like this? Sometimes people don't know about a certain movie so how would you then explain your idea to them?
 
 
 
 1. colored light programmed by arduino
 
 2. Virtual Reality gaming
 
 3. Motion Capture rc car"
"I felt that although these explanations were brief, and could have used a bit more detail, the ideas were expressed relatively clearly in such few words. 
 
 
 
 Idea 1: A program that uses an arduino and three buttons. When a button is pushed, an assigned color appears. 
 
 
 
 Idea 2: A program that makes people feel as though they are part of a virtual reality world. The program would involve the whole body, and the user would feel as though they left the real world and were transported into the game. 
 
 
 
 Idea 3: A program that allows a person to drive a car or fly a plane using only hand movements."
"I think the student made an effort with their ideas, although they could use more information as to what tools they would want to try and use. For example, in his third idea, it is unclear as to what softwares or hardware would be needed in order to control the car or plane.
 
 
 
 Reiteration of ideas:
 
 Idea 1 - Using arduino, make an interactive system with 3 buttons that change colors.
 
 Idea 2 - Submerge a user into a virtual reality world.
 
 Idea 3 - Control RC car or plane with hand movements."
"I had a bit of difficulty understanding the third idea, but overall I felt that Tammy explained her ideas well. 
 
 
 
 1.In a week, Tammy would brainstorm, collect data, create a virtual and a paper prototype, and gather information from users and experts regarding her project. 
 
 2.Tammy would create a therapy program for children with special needs. She would use her resources to hire experts in related fields, and try to create the best program possible. 
 
 3.Tammy would create a mechanism that would record neurological feedback, and heart rate, when a user is exposed to certain stimuli."
"If me and this student were assigned to work on a project I think that both of us would have to come to a compromise since I am not skilled in the area that the student is speaking of doing a project on. I believe that the second idea that the student spoke on is a project that we could actually work on together, and we could also combine aspects of the first and third idea together to make a really cool project."
"It seems that this student detailed how their proposed project for the semester would look in a week, a semester, and in an unspecific amount of time with a billion dollars, rather than proposing three different ideas. The idea seems to be to make hardware, like a robot, that mimics the way the human body looks and works, with the end goal of using it to study the form of the body. The purpose of studying the form is not clear, though with the types of things this student wishes to do, it appears to be useful for general knowledge of the body for anyone that may want to know, whether artistic or health-related."
"This seems rather hardware-focused for the semester, while my skills focus on software. I'd be able to make it into more of an active, functional robot, perhaps as a way to simulate how the human body would move and react to various factors."
"This student definitely put a lot of thought into all of their project ideas. For the first idea, she goes into what she would do for the first week, such as planning, budgeting, getting the proper equipment, and meeting with professionals in the field she wishes her project to be in. As for the project itself, I'm not entirely sure what she is aiming to do. She wishes to use neural feedback, as well as feedback from a sensor that gets data from heartbeat. 
 
 
 
 For the second idea, it sounds like she would use the billion dollars to get a bunch of experts (in their respective fields) to help create a sort of therapy for special needs children. She would also have a bunch of equipment to show a progression of their healing/recovery. To me, it sounds like idea 2 is a further expansion of idea 1, which totally clears some stuff up for me.
 
 
 
 For the third idea, it's what has been going on for the previous two. Using data from the brain and the heart to get some sort of outcome. She was unsure of what is realistic for the time given this semester. She didn't propose three different items, but rather one idea that has different outcomes based on her time and money."
"Since it's one idea this is easy! For a semester, to have us actually work on, we would definitely need some scaling back. As far as a sort of machine to measure brain waves, I have no idea how to use it, or where to get one. This poses a big problem for us. As far as something for the heart, this might be a little difficult too. I'm not sure if you want an actual heart sensor, and what you need it for. They do have pulse sensors (http://goo.gl/7kFhfY) that you can use to measure heart rate, and are used by putting the sensor at either your fingertip or your earlobe. The people that created the sensor have a newer version of their product, which may be a better source of a pulse. 
 
 
 
 With all this, I'm not sure what you would want to accomplish. I'm not an expert on psychological aspects, so I'm not sure what would come out of having these strapped to a person, especially just for the heart sensor. You can tell when someone maybe is scared or something, but as far as getting that data and making something out of it, I have no idea. Especially because you want something that helps special needs children get better treatment I guess?"
So the first answer didn't really say anything that this student could accomplish. It was all very vague and I couldn't figure out what the mobilemousecase project was.
If I knew what this student wanted to work on I would be able to gage what we could do together but I'm not sure what their interests are.
No they did not stretch our thinking. 1. No idea 2. go to Dubai 3. A mobile mouse case.
"I dont really know what the mobile mouse case is but going to Dubai sounds like fun, I had a blast last time I was there."
I don't know what mobile mouse case is. It sees like you can use your mobile as a mouse. Very interesting. Hope you can do it!
"It sounds as if you have one solid idea. Could you elaborate a little more on it? You call it your mobile mouse case, so what exactly makes it specialized?"
"I'm pretty sure I couldn't contribute very much. By the sound of it, this student has a pretty good grasp on what they plan on doing. However if they were accepting help I might be able to help craft the project. I spent a year in industrial design crafting prototypes and I might be able to lend a hand in the actual making of this product."
"Some of the ideas were successful, and some weren't. I think their idea 2 was the strongest."
"I really liked the idea 2. We would definitely have to modify it, but I think that within our own phoenix community there are a lot of dichotomies physical appearances."
"The person didn't put too much thought into this one.
 
 The first idea is to create a small digital physical system or installation that looks cool.
 
 The second idea is to connect everyone by creating a internet infrastructure that uses solar/kinetic powered equipment.
 
 The third idea is to simply create a interactive mobile phone app."
I don't really feel like this student stretched the thinking on this assignment. The effort was barely made for this assignment.
I don't know what this student wanted to do so I'm not sure how we could collaborate. A game or installation is very vague.
"Their ideas are far too vague, I can't really start to picture what they had in their mind from this limited explanation. I am not too sure they too this assignment with the utmost sincerity. That being said, the general idea of what they wish to accomplish is quite clear due to its concentration of words. However, many questions about their ideas exist. Why do we need a new internet infrastructure? What type of game/app do you want to develop? What type of installation do you wish to build, and with what tools?
 
 
 
 Their ideas: 
 
 
 
 One Week: A small digital installation that has physical elements to it.
 
 
 
 Unlimited Time and Money: To create a new infrastructure for the internet that allows for everyone to be connected using solar/kinetic power as its power source.
 
 
 
 Realistic Semester: To create an interactive mobile game."
"I think the student put in effort but the ideas are still very vague for idea 2 and 3.
 
 
 
 Idea 1 - The idea mentioned painting the body of his motorcycle.
 
 
 
 Idea 2 - The idea mentioned creating a project that would make people more physically active. How would you go about promoting that? What motive would people have to jog instead of drive somewhere (especially when your destination is very far away)?
 
 
 
 Idea 3 - The idea mentioned creating a social media app for motorcycle riders. Need more information on what this app does, what software/programming language you are using, etc."
"Combining these ideas is somewhat tricky, since they seem to conflict with one another. On one side, you are trying to persuade people to be more physically active, but on the other side, there seems to be a big interest in motorcycling. If I had to extend on one of your ideas though, I'd maybe incorporate features to your social media app that not only talk about motorcycles, but also inform the public about being more physically active."
"I feel that all of their ideas could have been expanded upon, and I am not really sure what they had in mind for their second idea. What will this campaign to promote activeness entail? Would their be commercials and public events to help promote activeness? How will people commute to work? Will you design an Arcology and thus eliminate cars altogether? I could feel the sincerity behind their words, but they could have been a little more concrete with this desires, this would have helped in the clarity of their plans.
 
 
 
 Their ideas: 
 
 
 
 One Week: They would either design a decal or paint a mural on their motorcycle.
 
 
 
 Unlimited Time and Money: They wish to create a project that somehow makes people more physically active, they wish for this project to lower to usage of automobiles (and thus leading to less pollution and car related deaths).
 
 
 
 Realistic Semester: A social media app that acts like an internet forum for motorcycle rides and those who just generally love motorcycles."
"I mentioned designing an Arcology when referencing your second idea (making people more active). Maybe we could work that into your project this semester. Obviously you could not make such a structure in a semester, however maybe you could draw up some blueprints for it. You could design it so that people would not have to use cars to get anywhere with everywhere being accessible by walking or elevators. You could look up how to make a self sufficient Arcology and try to incorporate that into your blueprints, was well as where you would place emergency services, housing, commercial, and schools."
I believe the student put in a lot of effort but I only seem to see two distinct ideas.
"I think that you have some good ideas. I really liked the first idea that you came up with it sounds as if you have put some thought into it. As for your second idea, would it be possible to empower these communities with a simplified version of your plan. When I think of the struggles that these communities have to deal with, my first notion is not that they are in need of jobs. Couldn't you help provide these communities with the means of acquiring power without setting up a full on power plant? Is there a cheaper, more dispensable means of creating a power generating device for these communities? Much like the paper water filter book, could you develop something that could provide usable energy at a low cost?"
"The three ideas were creating a short film that can inspire and also intrigue an audience, help make the world a better/happier place without the use a pharmaceutical drugs, and to learn more of the side of engineering and development. Some of the answers were pretty vague, like what type of film do you think would be inspirational, what type of audience or culture would you like to base it off of or target the film to? What do YOU think can make the world happier? Just try to expand more on these ideas and it would help."
Didnt go much in depth on any of the ideas. Pretty vague.
Not sure since I cant seem to figure out what the projects are exactly.
"The student actually made a sincere effort and I believe gave very honest answers, except for the third answer, the student didn't really answer the question or give an idea. The student actually clearly proposes two things, the first idea was about making an inspirational film, the second idea was about researching what makes a human happy without drugs, and to make a device that trains the human brain to think in a positive and non negative way."
"Your film idea is kind of vague. Inspirational can be so many things to so many people, you might want to focus on a specific topic over everything else. For your second idea, a ton of research would need to be made. You said you'd like to make the world happy with out the use of pharmaceutical drugs which makes me think you're also trying to have something that will help fight depression, not just boredom or sadness. A thing to keep in mind is that the brain holds onto more negative thoughts than positive. The third idea almost sounds like you'd like to know more about developing a program? I'm not really sure what you'd want to accomplish, but you should look for a group that is well rounded, and pay attention to your developers."
"I like the idea about making people happy and I know there is someone else who would like to do something similar to that in this class. What I think I would do first with this idea is to set a specific group (like college students around campus) and just go out and start interviewing. If you have a set list of questions its easy to just go up to someone and ask for some input. The good thing about starting on campus is that there are so many students from all different backgrounds, you'll start to get that wide variety of research you're looking for."
"In the first idea, they clearly propose they would make a short film that was inspirational and intriguing to an audience. The only thing about this is, different people feel different emotions. What is intriguing to one person could bore the living hell out of another.
 
 
 
 The second idea is basically saying they want to make people happy! Without the use of any drugs. I fully support this idea.
 
 
 
 There isn't really a third idea, just the student saying that they want to work more with the development side of things."
"I really would love to go off of the whole making people happy thing, but again, emotions are very subjective. Unless we actually had something that is proven to effectively make different people happy each time they use this product, it wouldn't work well. I mean, we could take a survey of everyone in DC and ask them what they think is funny, or what makes them happy, and you can make a short film on it?"
"So the second idea is definitely not in reach for a semester. You could combine the first and third ideas though. Obviously a short film would have some sort of sound, but maybe you could make a short film documenting how much you learn about music?"
"I think he/she seem like a visual artist and want to make project is related with visual things. However, it was hard to realize and imagine that is actual project that he/she want to make."
"It was little hard to imagine what project would be. However, I agree with a week would be short week to develop a project. Also, some project could not make with unlimited fund and short time. I think you are good visualist and if you collaborate with other designers such as sound, media installation, and animator, it would be great project during this semester. Moreover, you can make plant to connect these three ideas that visual, clean water or self driving system, and music stuff. These are would be great project to interective each system to make human life better."
"Idea 1: a short film discussing a topic of interest.
 
 Idea 2: Work to organize and fund the creation of something that could provide clean water to people, or use a similar process for a different issue.
 
 Idea 3: Make music. 
 
 
 
 Though the specifics are a little vague, this student has proposed three ideas and has touched on the details and motivations for them."
The student wrote vaguely about their own motivations and didn't really provide any ideas for a project.
There aren't any proposed ideas to go off of to make into a project
"1) Vague notion of video editing
 
 2) vague notion of humanitarian efforts
 
 3) Vague notion of creating music.
 
 
 
 Basically, it's pretty vague."
Maybe something with iterative video? Take video of people wanting previous participants and do some sort of synthesis using the similarities (or differences).
"The student said they could make some sort of interactive installation, something robotic, or a matrix made of LEDs for the first idea. For the second idea, the student said that instead of one huge project, they would would work on making what we have easier to make and at cheaper costs. This way, more people could make things to solve more problems. For the third idea, I kind of don't understand it, but that's totally on me because it seems like they know what they are talking about. I'm just not sure the final outcome."
"To be honest, pretty sure I'm not on this person's level, neither thinking, or actual like tinkering. Obviously you could blend the first and the third projects because you mention an installation, lights, and robotics. I'm not sure how interactive the third idea is, but maybe instead of a camera looking at the hanging LEDs from below, it can look at it from above and have people walk under the lights? This way like if someone is walking and the lights are hanging too low, you can move them up with the pulley system you were mentioning. And use a Kinect to measure distance."
"The person has a broad range of interests, but I feel that the first two responses are really vague since they talk about what kind of projects they want to work on rather than what projects. Also, what they specified in the first question may be something that would be more than they can handle in one week.
 
 
 
 The third idea is much clearer as they explain their project and its structure and functions. 
 
 
 
 Their three ideas are some project that deals with electrical devices, a cheap hardware to help people, and a mechanical display that moves in fluid-like motion."
"The third idea has a lot to work with, so I would like to extend that into a large art piece that can be placed at a water show or a museum of machines. I think it would be interesting to see the inner working, like cables and light connections, to give the display some flair too."
"I know nothing about music and theater, but maybe with my sculpture skills we could design a set. Although the set would be here in Tempe, it could reference South Korean theater and draw attention to the South Korean theater community both here and abroad."
There is great expanse on ideas and passions in this idea run. The first idea is to use MAX/MSP to create a sound to light interactive system. The second idea is to create a theatre company that can reproduce the quality of theater performances here in america in countries without significant funding for musicals and theatre performances. The third idea is to create new content for a musical play.
"I found this classmates ideas interesting, but had difficulty understanding the details, and how their ideas would be accomplished. 
 
 
 
 1. In a week, this classmate would brainstorm and ask key questions about their project. They are most interested in working on a project that connects sound and visuals. 
 
 2. This classmate would like to create an infinite theatre, with an interactive component. The theatre would involve state of the art equipment and take up an unlimited amount of space. 
 
 3. In a semester, this classmate would create an interactive performance scene."
"If I were to work with this classmate I would be most interested in working with him to create an infinite theatre. This idea sounded interesting, but I couldnt quite understand the details or picture the end result. I think this project would involve a great deal of technological and artistic components, but I would need to have a better understanding of the project to know what was needed to physically accomplish it."
"The person has given thought to it, but doesnt describe the ideas quite enough.
 
 The first idea is to create a graphic novel.
 
 The second idea is to create a cartoon from the characters he/she has already created.
 
 The third idea is is to ultimately create a graphic novel."
"All of the ideas have to do with either graphic novels or cartoons, so why not create a connection. Make a book that has the cartoon within it. Create a book, then put a screen within it, and instead of having a regular graphic novel, the cartoon appears."
"1) Graphic novel
 
 2) full cartoon
 
 3) Webcomic leading into graphic novel.
 
 
 
 I would have liked more detail on each idea. None of these are fleshed out enough for my liking."
"Perhaps a more augmented graphic novel, with thick ""pages"" for sensors and actuators, so we could provide sound effects (using tiny speakers) and some motion (motors under paper). Like the pop-up book of the future."
I can see where this student was heading. So there ideas were thoughtful but just not expressed deeply through the assignment but it is obvious they have passion for this project.
I just have NO idea of what this person is saying.
"The first idea would be to develop a 3d character.
 
 The second idea is to develop a full length animation that is intense and far beyond a few month's capabilities.
 
 The third one is to build upon your skills as an animator and develop something you're proud of."
Didnt go into much depth besides speaking of animation.
3D animation and psychology. Maybe a project that uses animation to help some sort of psychological disorder?
I would collaborate with this student to create real stimulating sound for the virtual world idea. One of the most important parts of our experience and reality is the 5 senses. I would want to make sure the sound design is perfectly matched to how it is in reality.
"All of your ideas seem to be based around developing some sort of game or program. It isn't that I don't find these ideas interesting, however what other projects might you be open to? For example, with your second idea: Would you take it a step further and utilize the Oculus Rift headset?"
"I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to offer you much assistance with your project. Although I have some experience developing games and programming, I have a very limited knowledge on the subject. However if you needed somebody to help craft something or to help develop character designs, I could be the man for the job."
If me and this student were assigned to collaborate together for the semester I would like to explore the possibilities of the students' last idea that involved a new way of playing video games with the cube that involves the first idea and some elements of the second idea.
"I think your anti screen looking project idea is amazing, too often I have caught my younger brother committing this cardinal video game sin. The cube was a great idea, ignoring the top and bottom of the cube you have 4 surfaces and with video games often offering 4 player co-op you can projection map on each of the sides. you can make the cube sort of a furniture piece, coming with chairs (maybe cubes as well), and a way to easily store it+its projectors. I can not help you on the lines of knowing Max, but I think you should think ahead a bit to on how you could market such an awesome device/piece of furniture. The cube look could work as a ""futuristic"" vibe and that alone could be enough to get people interested. You could also make it so that it could be installed in arcades or bars allowing people to play games with friends or strangers."
"You have a good grasp on what you'd like to do. As long as you're comfortable with projection mapping I believe that all of your ideas will work. I'm not exactly sure what you would do with the art gallery, but if you've made some pieces of you're own you could make them pop using the projection. I also like that you're thinking of working with kids. You can do a lot with the idea of making an interactive environment around them, and even make it so that they can visit different places around the world from their own bed. The only thing I'm concerned about with the xbox is the split screen projection mapping. You might have to work with 2 different projectors."
I'd want to work more with your clothing brand idea. If you have some physical objects that people could model you could take video of that and then build a runway like stage to make an infinite runway. Along it you could use projection mapping on some mannequins along the way so that people can look at what you have.
"I do not think that I could help out with project 1 in much of a way as I do not have any carving experience, but possibly I could assist in the formation of ideas 2 or 3. The ideation seems pretty confident with project three so I think I could only assist in the actual physical construction of the installation, it doesn't seem like there would be much software involved. In idea 3 I could possibly help in the ideation process and define a solid idea of what the implemented project actually will be."
"This is the most well thought out and fully realized pitches for an idea I've read so far. The carving of a wolf sounds like a lot of fun, but also a lot of work. The space installation sounds fascinating, especially the concepts being conveyed by the piece."
The idea about creating the frame sounds very unique. I would like to see something like that.
"This student can definitely go different ways into what type of project he or she wants to do. However, I think that maybe he or she should stick to some sort of project that has to do with geometry or coding or both."
"The person has definitely thought about it, and although the second idea doesn't have an exact project, the idea is there. 
 
 The first idea is to make a sculpture. 
 
 The second idea is to somehow create a way to emotionally connect with other people using technology of some sort. 
 
 The third idea is to create an installation that in short, involves a light and it delivers a message about personal serenity."
"I'm not really sure how I could tie these together honestly. The ideas are very different, but maybe I'm just not thinking outside the box enough. However, I am thinking that maybe you could just smash all the ideas together, creating the installation with the sculpture instead of the light and it allows people to feel what others are feeling. I'm not really sure though."
"Time travel has always been an interest of mine. That being said, and Alternate Timeline Transportation Device sounds pretty cool. Paradoxes are no fun, so this seems like a much more safe alternative."
"I'm not sure exactly what we could work on, but it seems like we both have similar interests based on the responses (Twitch, gaming, time travel) so the ideas would definitely be alike."
"This person shows really fun ideas that may or may not be simple but are interesting to see. The ideas are quite clear with specific features. 
 
 
 
 Their three ideas are simultaneous video game plays, virtual reality device that allows changes in the user's past, and an interactive display with a projection mapping of a mermaid."
"The interactive system featuring the mermaid and the inverse of Twitch Plays Pokemon seem like two appealing ideas that can be blended. I am thinking that the project could be an installation of tv and projector such that a video game console is hooked up to a tv, which has a projection mapping of a mermaid on the screen. Whatever button a user presses on their console, the button can affect the mermaid's behaviors."
I think we could take the last one and turn it into a project this semester. The equipment is already easily available and it wouldn't be much of a stretch to bring this project to life with the correct sensors and programming.
"I think these are some interesting ideas but they are a little over my head.
 
 The first is for some Pokemon game but I'm not too familiar with Pokemon games but i like the idea of projecting older games onto surfaces to give them a new feel.
 
 The second idea is for a alternate timeline which sounds cool but I'm confused how it would be executed.
 
 The last is for an interactive mermaid projection which seems to react to sound and motion."
"The last idea seemed the most doable I would try and focus on scope of the project though.
 
 Would it be life size or smaller?
 
 How would it work in a crowded room?
 
 How many reactions would the mermaid have?"
"All three responses are good ideas, even if idea #2 is currently technologically infeasible. 
 
 
 
 1. A setup that allows a player to play 5 simple games at once as an interesting experience. 
 
 
 
 2. A device that allows users to jump between timelines/ dimensions to try out different actions or choices in life. 
 
 
 
 3. A tank with a projection mapped mermaid inside that reacted to people in a room."
"I think that the mermaid tank idea is really interesting, though it would likely be rather difficult. Making a prototype of this however could be feasible in a semester or two, where a smaller or simpler object or the skeleton of the mermaid model could be mapped into a special fish tank."
"The ideas are definitely clear as they are and feel well thought-out. The first idea is a stand to hold various electronic devices and chargers on a stand, specifically next to a bed. The second idea is a low-cost wearable device that generates energy through being outdoors or exercising, potentially solving both energy and health problems through motivating people to exercise to charge their electronic devices. The third idea is a game in which the student does most of the artistic work (art, models, environments, etc), and although the exact design of the game is not clear, it appears the student would prefer to work on a shooter of some sort."
"As a game developer and programmer, I would be able to work with this student to create a game, given their lack of experience in programming. However, 'create a game' is incredibly broad, as games vary greatly based on their genre and theme, so it's difficult to lay out what type of game we would make; I would need to know more about this student's interests and what their goal is for the game."
"You'd like to make a stand to reduce the clutter of electronics. The problem with it is that there is stuff already kind of like that, and organizers already made. If you do make it so that its all contained with in the nightstand it could be really neat and even marketable. 
 
 
 
 For your second idea I think solar energy would be your best bet because I'm not sure of how you could take energy from the body and transfer it into a battery. With this idea, any article of clothing could be used for quick energy which would be pretty neat. The big problem I see is the lack of comfort from the clothing that you might get with attaching batteries and other things. People probably won't want to wear it if it's uncomfortable, especially if its hot. 
 
 
 
 The third Idea seems to be thought out, but I'm not sure what your concept is for the game. If you're good with animation you might be able to make a trailer that would spark interest for programmers. I think the biggest part before moving onto working with the occulus rift is to find that group to make your trailer and create a small part of the game."
"I like the idea of a hat or shirt that gathers electricity and i would want to branch off more on that, more because I'm not really sure about you're game idea, but I'd also like to learn more about it. As for the clothing, I think a big thing is focusing on the overall design of the clothing, to make sure that people would wear them. I also think development of a solar battery would need to go into the shits/hats/pants as well. Things to consider is if they need to be connected to the shirt at all times, how heavy they would be, and if the article are machine washable."
"The student could use more time to get more specific with the ideas.
 
 The first just states what they would work with not exactly what they would make.
 
 The second is for a system that automatically tended to a garden, I was wondering how this would be done.
 
 The last is for an interactive sculpture which seems interesting."
"I would try to help this student get more specific on there goals.
 
 What is the end result?
 
 How would you want people to feel?
 
 What would the sculpture be or do?"
"The ideas here aren't too fleshed out, but you've already begun to think about what things you would want in order to make something. Consider finding the limits of the technology, and go down from there."
"I really like the arduino planting idea. I'm not really sure what I add at this point, but the idea is interesting and could really find a use in different businesses around the world."
There are only two kind of vague ideas presented here. The first is a garden that would take care of itself utilizing an Arduino to do the physical work. The second is an interactive sculpture of some sort with no other details.
"The student put in a lot of time and effort into his/her ideas. Although these ideas are very detailed with what the student wants accomplished in the end, ideas 2 and 3 need more information as to what exactly Digital Culture students would be doing during the semester/year to apply their skills, aka, the ""engage and make it fun"" and ""find a way to expand"" needs work. I do understand the overall goal but this needs more explanation as to what a group of 4 students would be doing exactly.
 
 
 
 Reiteration of ideas:
 
 Idea 1 - Complete composition of two songs for cinematic, game, or advertisement.
 
 Idea 2 - Create campus ministries in all of the universities in America to establish relationships with the campus and business in the respective state.
 
 Idea 3 - Build partnerships with organizations and expand The Respect Movement to other campuses."
"Since your first idea seems to show an interest in creating music, I think you could tie this in with ideas 2 and 3. As an example, use the semester to create a song, maybe even a music video, to promote ideas 2 and 3. This music video could use projectors, cameras, and software that the digital culture has available to students."
"Your idea is very deeply thought out. Religion is an important aspect in an individual's life and it can help one out through college experience. I know the feeling of being wanting to fit into a group or service that you are interested and passion about. Your project seems very interesting, not everyone will agree to religion but they will agree to a community build upon passion"
I would be interested in seeing how far this project would go. I want to see the process of this project campaign and how it is develop. The ministry service is an project that look like it would grow by time not so sure about how big but I would like to contribute someway to see that project grows.
This person made a sincere effort to express their ideas. This persons ideas were about creating clubs and organizations to help teach respect and other important things to our ASU students. These are some awesome ideas but I would try and leave religion out of it.
"The person has definitely thought of what they wanted to do. Although, I'm honestly not sure how exactly it would tie into digital culture. I do see potential in it though. Maybe some more thought about what digital culture is about, then try and make something that ties directly to that idea.
 
 The first idea is to basically make a song for someone.
 
 The second idea is to create an organization kinda like the Newman Center but better.
 
 The third idea is to become more connected with other campuses to create a more equal culture."
"Not sure if the second idea is really for the billion dollars if not simply use $100 and get away with $999'999,900 at hand, but hey, honestly I would like some of that cheddar too. But I digress:
 
 
 
 This person has obvious interests in using projection mapping as a central thematic and makes absolute sense. Except, again, for the eyebrow-raising budget of a billion dollars for a simple project like that."
"I am intrigued by the project on the third bullet, only thing that keeps me wondering how well it would work is just the movement part because part of the illusion of space involvements like this is kinesthesic activity.
 
 
 
 SO!
 
 
 
 Introducing Virtuix Omni: a treadmill specifically designed of VR movement. http://www.virtuix.com/
 
 
 
 Perhaps using this could help with the production, albeit I am not sure if it would work way much better using Oculus Rift as well, which might just ruin the point of creating a projected environment outside.
 
 
 
 But I digress, I can sense something brewing."
"The ideas of a physical object that can be projected on with animations that can cater to the shape, a cloth or outfit that can be tracked and projected onto for plays and musicals, and a Immersive animation sequence that give the persona sense of being in the POV of the character. You did give this sincere effort and I do like the three of your ideas. I actually love the idea of the clothing that can be tracked and projected onto. It sounds extremely difficult but since your given a billion dollars I'm sure you can accomplish it."
I would help this artist to consider the time involved in animating because they would be making two animations which is going to eat up some time especially if they want to work in 3D. I would also hope they had some ideas on what the character looked like or the environment they character would be in because I would want to get started on the animations as soon as possible.
"Idea number one doesn't seem like much of an idea. It seems like this student is saying they would just spend the week brainstorming. Ideas 2 & 3 both have to do with getting clean water to those around the world who need it most. They also seem like the same idea, just in different words."
The ideas are great. The steps of making a one-week project are organized. But they are too general so I can't develop more ideas base on that.
"The student put in effort into their ideas but I think more details are needed, as well as possible tools/skills that would be required. In idea 2, I love the idea, but how would you incorporate the solar energy part with this clean water process? In idea 3, I think more information is needed as to what materials/tools/skills would possibly be required for a group of students to create possible prototypes.
 
 
 
 Reiteration of ideas:
 
 Idea 1 - Creation of the outline, draft, visual presentation, write up, and materials required for a possible project.
 
 Idea 2 - Provide clean water to people, and also an air transport system to collect rain water, purify it, and then distribute it, by using solar energy.
 
 Idea 3 - Create prototypes of idea 2 and distribute it with biodegradable containers."
"There is a lot of excess verbiage; it sounds like an ad for Pottermore. Your description needs to show more objectiveness, like someone just talking about it not someone excitedly looking forward to it."
"Is Pottermore a game or does it interact with the books? In your description, it almost sounds like a game based on a book, and I am not sure that fits the criteria."
"You have a lot of examples in your entry. If you remove those and just show a variety of blogs types, styles and topics and maybe a blog 101 that would work better."
"I do not think the history of writing or the technology based readers is needed nor are the steps technology has made in computers. They make no difference to the system you are discussing. 
 
 I think if you keep your description to factual based reporting of the systems it will work better in the guide."
There is a lot of information there. Reddit appears to be an ever expanding source of information. If this is so then it meets the challenge like the blog.
I wonder if Reddit has everything like you state. How is the information validated? Are there actual books there or is it just blogs and just used for information look up? Your guide is slightly confusing to me if you could clarify I would appreciate it.
"Describing the lenticular printing process earlier in the summary might be helpful to the reader, allowing us to get a better mental image of what is being described without resorting Google to get a quick and dirty definition."
"I'm looking forward to seeing what kind of image you use for this post. Perhaps adding a link to the different types of posts you described (photo-centric, media, text, etc) to give the reader the chance to see how the site works would be helpful?"
"Repetition of ""lore"" in the summary. Consider using synonyms in the other places this word was used? Extra word in first sentence of section 3: ""While Pottermore is limited to <b>to</b> Harry Potter"". Awkward phrasing: ""or eventual silver screen"". Consider revising wording and encasing this section in parenthetical?"
"Consider adding html links to research citations and the 99% Invisible podcast. This line confused me: ""Pew Research reports that in the past 30 years the levels of individuals over the age of 18 who do not has doubled."" What are these people not doing? Consider revising wording to make this reference clear."
"I encountered several run-on sentences throughout the assignment. This made it difficult to follow the author's arguments. Consider revising and parsing arguments out into a more centralized format. Additionally, incorrect word usage (""is becoming more patience"", ""provides the reader to"", ""as oppose to a book"", etc) made it extremely difficult to assimilate the author's meaning."
"Having no idea what an ""augmented reality reading experience"" is, your summary only confused me! Maybe somehow include in that initial summary that this product's purpose is to deliver a 3D reading and viewing experience. That is the point of this technology, correct?
 
 
 
 Also, the following sentence is confusing: ""At this time, it is an iPhone or iPad but there is an Android version under development."" I ran into many of these ""for instances"" and kept having to reread sections of your assignment. It was choppy to me and a hard read. There are numerous run on sentences and a plethora of facts but not enough explanation.Perhaps my best advice to you, as someone who has never heard of such a technology, is to reread your assignment and pretend you're in my shoes.
 
 
 
 Good luck!"
"The only thing I can say could use a bit of revising would be that you kept repeating that this book is a compilation of many different people's thoughts. I felt while reading your assignment that you may have repeated this so many times in different ways to fill space and hit the required word counts. If this is true, it's unfortunate because you did a great job on this assignment. I'd omit some of these repetitive phrases in your final draft.
 
 
 
 I also noticed the misspelling of a word in the following sentence: ""What makes this book afuture book is that it doesnt have a single author. It is more like an interactive blog or news feed on an internet social media sight ([SITE]<--change to this spelling) that an actual book."""
"I disagree with you that the future of books will be audiobooks! That's besides the point though and a personal opinion, not a literary critique. In all, I think that you completed this assignment in a purposeful, meaningful manner.
 
 
 
 Perhaps the only critique I have is that maybe you could explain why audiobooks haven't already taken off (it's a media that's been around for quite some time) and expand on the idea of why now is the audiobook's perfect opportunity for a comeback."
"UNFORTUNATELY, I don't think that your assignment needs much revision. You did an excellent job of ""doing it right the first time"" and it is obvious that your sentences are thoughtful and calculated.
 
 
 
 If anything, maybe include the pottermore.com link in your summary?
 
 
 
 Great work. I'm looking forward to reading and ""critiquing"" your future assignments for this class!"
"I had a hard time finding the strengths of your assignment, as I don't think that you followed the assignment prompt. After reading and rereading your writing, I'm not clear as to what you think the future book will look like. I understand that you've done some family history research and plan on passing it down to your children and your children's children via digital photography and writing, though I have no idea about what you think the future of books will be.
 
 
 
 Please see my constructive criticism below, as I think that your rough draft needs some major rewriting."
"Your summary isn't very clear. My first suggestion would be to rewrite this portion of the assignment and be straightforward, not leaving anything to be guessed or assumed. The purpose of a summary is to tell the reader exactly what they are about to read, not to leave them wondering what your subject matter is and what they're about to get involved with.
 
 
 
 Of the five assignments I've read, yours needs the most amount of revision in my opinion. I'm not exactly sure how to approach your writing, as I kind of think the whole thing needs to be rewritten. The assignment was to decide on what the future of the book will be and give a 300 word explanation of it, followed by why you think that society is leaning in the direction of your chosen mode of literary media. To me, your assignment just seems to tell of how you've done some research on your family history. Perhaps you should read through the assignment prompt again, as I think that you may have been confused as to what we were supposed to write about. Maybe I'm so wrong and I've completed the assignment incorrectly, but mine follows the same guidelines as the other four I've just critiqued.
 
 
 
 I hope you don't find my response as rude, would just rather tell it to you straight as you have an opportunity to fix your assignment before you turn in the final draft - that's a good thing!"
"The description falls short, not just in word count, but in its aim to make me want to go out and read this book immediately. Vegan or not, the book should make me want to see what makes it different, how it can be a ""future"" book. I think with a little more explanation, this description could stand out more. Figure out exactly what makes Emily special to the vegan cookbook world. How is she innovative? If it's not just a cookbook, explain why."
"The future factor explanation is very well done. I definitely want to find something like this, as I'm sure most people who enjoy faster processing would. By appealing to the demand of the people, this entry meets the challenge, though it does not offer a way for people to actually find such a book."
"This entry did not find a specific book, but instead wrote about a hypothetical one. The main challenge is to think of books creatively, but this does not pinpoint something that I can actually go out and see for myself. I would suggest trying to find a hybrid-type book, or at least something that could become hybrid very easily."
"By not giving a real example of such a book, this entry is not completed. While the exact book the author speaks of may not yet exist, an example should still be found, per the assignment. The author should find something that is similar so that I can at least see what they're talking about a little more clearly."
"Perhaps in the future factor section, the author could make a solid case for why exactly I should go out and buy it. While obviously I'm interested, what specifically makes this book extra appealing, and why?"
"Perhaps add more written examples in the middle section, creating an overall convincing entry."
"The only thing I think may have been too bold of a statement was when you said that ""film will always be more powerful than text"". I do think that this is a rather subjective statement, as many individuals absolutely become enchanted by and involved in a story when it is on page, because so much is left up to their own imagination. The voice and image of a character, the tone or the character's overall mood, the atmosphere of a building or of a place - and the beauty of written text, at least in fictional stories, is that my perception of a character will never match another's; yet, in a film, a character appears in a very straightforward way, with very little interpretation to the viewer. I think it very much depends on the genre, for one to say that film is more powerful than text. Of course, if a demonstration or learning technique needs to be taught, I can definitely see how film is the way to go. But as for me, I have always been more comfortable with text, as it is easy for me to segment, control, and become enveloped in a story. I guess my critique would be to clarify WHEN film is more powerful than text (as you did) instead of making a general statement that film is ALWAYS better, as many people may not feel this is true. But, other then this, I literally thought that what you wrote was perfect, and I think you posed wonderful points and thoughts - great job!"
"The problem I see with tumblr is that there is no citation, and it is very easy to 'steal' one's work. In the tumblr guidelines, it explicitly states that all content you post is liable to be viewed and re-used by other people. This means someone can re-blog a story or poem you write, and totally trash it, or even edit it themselves. While this is wrong and most individuals wouldn't do this, there is nothing in the tumblr guidelines stating that this is wrong, and tumblr staff cannot be held responsible for if an OP is not given credit for a 'stolen' picture or post. In the future, do you think that there could be an add-on to tumblr that instates a rule or a policy that enables an original poster to always receive credit for their work? If books are moving to be completely online, would not this be necessary on a site like tumblr, if an author wanted to maintain their credibility and their autonomy as the original writer of a work?
 
 Also, another problem I see is that, while there is SO MUCH creativity possible on tumblr, there is not really a place for those who want to become involved in a story to go. If I wanted to read an entire, thousand page book, or even a book series, I would not go on tumblr to do it. It just isn't possible to read so much information on a post. In addition, an author cannot make any profit, or gain any credit other than recognition from writing a book - so if tumblr were to be the future of books, there would be no way for a writer to make a living. Do you think that, in the future, it would be again possible to add on to the site a place for writers of long novels / book series? In this add-on, could it be included that one would have to purchase the author's work before being able to view it and reblog it? This way they are still following the 'tumblr way' and re-blogging work, but they are also honoring an author's time and energy, and cannot simply view it / re-blog without giving at least some form of tribute. This would also make it a lot less possible for someone to 'edit' or 'remove' the OP's part in the post, and it would also still allow for a re-blogger to leave commentary - just, the work wouldn't be free, as books are not free. 
 
 Just a thought! I think the idea of tumblr being the future of books is genius!"
"The only issue I see with your future book idea is that, unless actual books / stories are uploaded by Reddit users, one cant really become involved / pulled in to a fictional world or fantasy land. For many, books are a means of escape, and many book readers want to become involved in the lives of the characters, want to understand them and relate to them, fight for them or fight against them; also, many individuals who read also like the idea of an alternate world existing. For instance, I believe that this is why so many series, like Harry Potter, The Hunger Games, or The Lord of the Rings, were so huge  because there was another universe that readers could disappear into. 
 
 Im not saying that there is no possibility for things like this to exist on Reddit  but your post didnt really give the feeling that users post stories full of characters or alternate worlds. I think that, if you were to include that in the future, entire books and stories will be uploaded onto Reddit, that this is the way books may be read in the future. For instance, if you said something akin to the following,instead of authors publishing books through a publishing company, maybe they will publish their novels through websites such as Reddit, as so many individuals use this website, it would give the sense that books in general are moving in the direction of being completely online through such websites."
"I believe that the author should make sure to be more clear about the fact that you can use this book in more ways than just reading through pages. Although e-devices were mentioned, I was still confused as to whether or not this type of book would be hand-held, on an e-device, or both. How will the book be accessed on an e-device - from a website? Will it be purchased and downloaded instantaneously, or ordered? Will it have any software that must be installed onto an e-device? While the author said that this book would be available for e-devices, I feel it should be more explicitly stated that it can fluctuate between being an experience through page or through screen, both, or neither, because I am still unsure as to whether this book can be read in the way a traditional book is read, or if that is not the case at all. Other than this, this genre of future books sounds exciting!"
"For the most part, the article is solid, even if the ""Description"" section is a bit short.
 
 
 
 My only criticism is that the article seems to only give vague examples as the girth of interactive activities that are available on Pottermore. For example, fan fiction--it's described as a hub for it, what does Pottermore offer that other fanfiction hosting websites do not? How is fanfiction integrated with other areas of the website mentioned, if there is any at all? 
 
 
 
 Also, because Pottermore is an online entity, perhaps it would be helpful to include links?"
"While the links are certainly very helpful, the ""Description"" segment of the article seems to rely on them too much instead of making its own unique statement about what the app is and why the audience should be interested."
"The image provided doesn't seem to reflect the interactive nature of the website. Perhaps a screenshot of one of the activities described in the ""Description"" would be better?"
"It's a bit nitpicky, but ""I have selected"" is hardly necessary here. It would far more effectively to cut that out and stick with the basic summary of the work."
"Describing a specific blog, rather than just describing the medium in general, would probably be a better way of showcasing the nature of the blog. However, if the author chooses to continue with simply talking about blogs in general, linking to specific blogs and blogging platforms would be a good way to showcase the diversity mentioned here, rather than just assuring the audience that it exists."
"This is a reasonable example of the direction in which future books are heading, but as the author continues to develop the field guide, it may be interesting for the reader if some of the history of the comic book, particularly as it developed in Japan (Manga, Anime) and Korea (Manhwa) is provided, as well as some thoughts on where all of this may be going as we proceed through this century and beyond. For example, it would seem that this style of reading entertainment -- especially popular to young adults -- is well suited for eventual transformation into 3-D renderings, perhaps even holographic, at some point in the future. In addition, some reference and relevance to our course readings (if possible) would make for a stronger case in point."
"One area in which this entry may fall short (as is the case with my own entry) is that a specific work is not identified. It may be helpful if an example of something like this could be found and then used as a supporting basis for the remainder of the field guide. The implication that the technology of the book and of information in general is moving toward digital is, I think, a valid one, but I for one would like to learn a little more about the specific portions of DNA components that allow us to be able to track historical genetic data and what this technology could afford us in 50 or 100 years. Also, it's always a good idea (as I'm sure you know) if our academic writing can be supported by relevant citations that support our statements and speculations. As your entry thus far is merely a rough first cut (for all of us), this is probably already in your plans as you work toward a final version!"
"Since a good example has been found that demonstrates a current trend in the timeline of 'book technology' (past, present, and future), In working toward a final draft, the author should not forget to provide a back drop to Tumblr, perhaps by describing more about what lead to Yahoo's acquisition of this technology, provide some more details about Tumbler itself (images, descriptions), and to speculate on where this technology could be leading us and how it will impact the continuing evolution of the book. References to course readings would also be a plus, if applicable."
"As mentioned in other critiques, and as this idea continues to be refined, some thought should be spent on the possibility of describing the history of book technology and in providing suggestions for where our digital reading technology is taking us. To be sure, printed books have been a critical factor in the advancement of mankind, but I think it would be nice to read more about some of the differences between what some of us may have experienced as children and what amazing options are for the children of today. Extend this into the future, and the possibilities become quite exciting indeed!"
"The field guide attempts to show the ability that technology has to instantly document our lives and save that documentation forever, without fear of it being lost due to some physical destruction. The problem is we spend most of the field guide learning about the authors time his/her brother uploaded their DNA online in order to map back potential members of their gene pool. While this is interesting it seems to fall short of the assigned task of finding a (a real book, object, publication, real or virtual thing), not something made up."
"In the future factor section, the field guide slips away from the pragmatic approach taken in the description and delves into an area of more idealizing than explaining this thing in the desired technical manner."
"Though Unbound, the crowdsourcing platform for book publishing is really the futuristic aspect of the guide we only hear about it once we get to the last section. Instead of describing News from Gardenia so thoroughly we should be getting a description of how Unbound will change the future of text."
"While the Field Guide explains Reddit very well and enables the user of the guide to navigate the site with ease, its claims that Reddit is the future of books is a bit short sighted. While Reddit may be the future of DIY, self-help and information/resource based books, it will have a hard time treading in the rivers of fiction. Fiction is a huge aspect of books and text still and the Reddit community and the way the site is constructed would struggle in attempting to improve the fiction universe."
I would really think of new ways in which ebooks can change like the way the one described in the field guide did. Instead of assuming that mainly a transition from paper to electronic format is all that will happen. Fill your future factor section with more of what you think is a possibility of the ebook.
The only place I can see that it falls short is that this entry is not actually about a book or something intended to replace a book. It is about a set of applications that essentially act as peripherals to a book. Similar to the way that video game system accessories add capability to the existing system. It would also have been nice to have a some information about the platforms on which these applications are currently available.
"I do not believe this entry falls short. It effectively achieves its goal of describing this ergodic text and what books could look like in the future. I do, however, disagree that this text and those like it show the way forward for the book. I believe they are quite powerful as a novelty, as I believe printed books will become in the future. However, I don't believe they will go further than that and become an industry standard. It would be much more difficult for new authors overall to consistently produce multilayered content as a standard format. It would also get laborious for the reader and the format would no longer be unique. Ergodic literature can range from multilayered storytelling to works of art that use words as their medium. In order to remain as impressive as they are, they rely partially on the fact that the are so different from the traditional book. Additionally, while texts like these seem as though they would have to be produced as a physical book, that is not necessarily true either. A good example would be ""S."", by J.J. Abrams and Doug Dorst, as it is an ergodic text that is also available as an ebook and an audiobook."
"It is not made clear in the description if this resource can be used by someone reading the book for added effect to their reading experience or if it is simply intended that more condensed and interactive ebooks/websites will eventually replace books. I do not agree with the comment about ""the perfect book for the Twitter generation"". Such books and short versions of full-length texts already exist. An old example would be the novelization of the death of Superman and his eventual return. Roger Stern was tasked with novelizing the most popular comic book story arc in the history of the medium, titled ""The Death and Life of Superman"". It was so popular that DC Comics produced a more condensed novelization for younger readers, titled ""Superman: Doomsday and Beyond"" by Louise Simonson. Generally, readers go to books for a greater depth of information and storytelling, which they find immersive. It is usually film adaptations that go the more condensed route. I don't se how such an innovation could actually replace the modern book, until they provide the same level of information and storytelling, as well a similar practicality of use."
"There is no clear connection to the idea that this is an evolution of the book, or something bound to replace the book. It is a website. A very in-depth site with many features, but it is still not a place where on can go and read the seven official Harry Potter texts or an innovation that delivers those stories in another way but in the same depth. It is a great resource for fans, but it is still reliant on the existence of the books, in basically their traditional form, one which to build this universe."
"I think the author of this entry effectively argued their point I do not have any criticism, other than that the ""future factor"" section was definitely over 150 characters."
"I think this entry could spend a little less time describing less relevant things (i.e., the first paragraph of the second section) and focus instead on simply and succinctly describing some of the features of Ideo. It would be interesting to have a quick summary of the features offered by the Nelson, Coupland, and Alice concepts. This would allow for further exploration of the specific benefits of each feature as they relate to different potential readers."
"The only suggestion I might have is to focus a bit more on what makes this story special and different from anything we've ever read before, rather than on being so descriptive about the characters or parts of the story. I definitely do want to hear a little about the story line, but feel there is a little bit too much of it here. I want to learn about the characters' reasons for doing things by reading the web comic itself, rather than from a summary. But overall I think this entry makes an excellent case for ""Annarasumanara"" as a futuristic book!"
"Some quick grammar edits I noticed:
 
 Film is powerful, and ""showing"" something to a learner is much more relatable that ""explaining"" something to a learner. -- that needs to be than.
 
 Babies cry when their hungry or uncomfortable and are not capable of fending for themselves. --their needs to be they are or they're.
 
 
 
 ""Film will always be more powerful than text."" This is a huge statement, and I don't think this one film or field guide backs up this statement. Your paragraph after this begins to argue that watching something on a page would be somehow better than reading words on a page, but you don't explain why. Probably I got bristled by this just because I'm a huge reader--for me, text will always be more powerful than film. But I think it might be easier to stick to this specific film, and say why this film is more powerful as a movie than it would be in book form. It is so much easier to prove a smaller point than a larger one, and the length limits for this assignment were so limited the space is really restricted to make a larger point.
 
 
 
 Also, I love your idea of a future book, in the third part, but the instructions read to describe what makes this specific item a future book. So again, I would maybe draw back to the movie Babies and talk a bit more about what the future factor of this film is. I think you could even move the last paragraph of your summary down to that third part, and get into a bit more of the movie's documentary aspect in the middle part, an exploration of the documentary as 'book' in the middle section.
 
 
 
 Oh, also I believe you need a pic! Somewhere in there. There were so many amazing shots in that film, I'm sure you can find a great screenshot online. Or, I'm not sure if this is possible with html but I believe it is, I bet you could link the trailer here from Youtube and use that as your pic? That might give readers the best idea of the film."
"Some quick grammar fixes I noticed:
 
 ""two hundred years in the future to a world that is recognizable yet alien""--I don't think this is grammatically wrong, I'm not sure, but I feel like ""two hundred years into a future world that is recognizable yet alien"" might read a bit smoother? Totally up to you, of course, but I just wanted to throw it out there.
 
 ""Truly a novel that inspires the reader to at least acknowledge that sustainability and human equality is possible.""--This sentence doesn't have a subject, I think it might make more sense to say ""Lllewellyn has written a novel that truly inspires the reader to acknowledge that sustainability and human equality is, at the very least, possible,"" or something like that. That authors name has so many L's!
 
 
 
 I don't have too much other constructive feedback, I think your choice of novel and why it is a future book is so right on. I guess maybe your title could be a little more powerful, but that is me straining for some more feedback to give you, to be honest. I think you have room to add some more descriptors in there, which might hook the reader in a bit more and pull them down into your assignment--your summary is so intriguing, but your title doesn't match that. Maybe: ""News from Gardenia by Robert Llewellyn is a utopian science fiction novel created, in part, by its readers.""
 
 
 
 Also, I'm not sure the sentence where you say you feel disloyal saying it isn't from the future is very clear. The whole wording of this part has to be sort of awkward as we're talking about a ""future"" book, and so it is awkward to figure out how to take about that, but you are saying it is from the future, right? So maybe ""This is from the future because"" because you aren't saying it isn't from the future? Does that make sense?"
"I love your concept of the role playing book, and I do agree that this is already happen to an extent. I think it would help if you gave a specific book that this is already happening with, as I believe this was the assignment. 
 
 
 
 So here is where I know this is happening. James Frey's new book, I believe it is called EndGame, will include a mystery with hidden gold (?) I think and an app produced by Google, so people can solve the mystery, plan on the app, and solve the game. Here is a link: http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/comic-con-james-frey-introduce-719685
 
 
 
 Google Niantic labs makes Ingress, an interactive real world game which people have written many books about, where you are battling in the real world for I think access to power points or something?"
"I think you need to pick a single specific book or other media source in existence today (game, choose your own adventure book) and describe that. I'm sure there is something out there that fits your description.
 
 
 
 You mention Phantasy Star in your summary, so if you choose to focus on that, I think your title should explain Phantasy Star, your description should explain Phantasy Star, etc.
 
 
 
 I gave examples of the Role Playing Book above that I could think of off the top of my head but the book that has always reminded me of a Choose Your Own Adventure Novel is Italo Calvino's If on a winter's nite a traveler... so you may also want to check that one out? You don't choose your own path in it, but you, as the reader, are written into the book.
 
 
 
 Also, I think you could compare Choose Your Own Adventure Novels to hyperlinks on the internet. Really, when we browse the internet, we are choosing our own adventure with each click. Instead of flipping to a different page in the book, we are moving to a different web page online. But until you focus on a single item, I don't think this assignment is done correctly."
"Some of the other concepts presented are awesome and future-esque, but this is by far the most intensely future-esque concept presented! Very cool. I'm surprised I haven't heard about this more, as it sounds so revelatory.
 
 
 
 I think each of these concepts sounds so complicated, it might be easier to focus on just Alice at it was the one that caught your attention."
"I was so interested in this that I looked it up online, and it looks like you took some of your info and text ""The team looked at how digital and analog books currently are being read, shared and collected, as well as at trends, business models and consumer behavior within related fields."" straight from their website? Bummer. It is important not to do this, as you will for sure get in trouble for it. If you have any other cut/copied text in there, get it out of there because Prof. Finn said he would run this through plagiarism software and it will catch this.
 
 
 
 What you want to try to do is read the web page, think about the information and process it, but say it in a completely different way. Or if you still want to say it in exactly that way, you need to attribute it to the web page.
 
 
 
 I think this is a lot to write about, as it sounds sort of overwhelming and complicated as three different book-related technologies. To me, it would be more digestible to just approach it from Alice, since you said that was the more interesting one. That way, there may be less pressure to summarize so much of what the company is doing, and it might be easier to just explain the technology of Alice itself?"
"I think what I'm missing here, from the title down, is a clear and brief description of what augmented reality is or how it works. Are there glasses? What makes it different than how I use my iPhone or iPad now? The pictures become 3D when I look at my iPad? I point my iPad at a picture? Where is the picture, what do I point at the iPad, my eyes or the picture? I guess for the non-techie, that aspect lost me. Just a slower, more clear description of the process of reading in this augmented reality. I pick up my iPad, and then what happens? Is there text on the screen, or only pictures? 
 
 
 
 What are QR codes? I would leave that part out, and focus on explaining the process of reading this sort of book like you're talking to someone who only reads hardback novels, and has no idea about the tech world. Just walk them through the experience. I'm a fan of making things really simple.
 
 
 
 And for some reason your title shows up as ""Untitled 341,"" but then you have a subtitle? So I'm not sure what happened there, if that was a glitch in the system or something."
"I think that the entry fell short on providing more reasoning as to why it will be a future book, and I would suggest to explain more about it."
"I think that the entry falls short in the reader not understanding the reason this book can be the future book, It give the reader many explanation about but not very well convincing. I think that it needs to be more convincing as to why this can be a future cook."
I think that this entry had good supporting information as to why it can be a future book. I think that the reader was convinced and maybe provide more information in proving the point of why it is the future book.
"I think that the entry did not fall short and that its was well written with enough information for the reader to be convince. The only feedback would be about the font, It was not the regular font which is New Times Roman, that should be changed."
I think that the entry did not fall short and the reader was convinced that the digital books and society adapting to modern technology will enhance the demand to want digital books. I think maybe explain his question at the end.
"First of all, there are certainly some typographical errors that are easily corrected, such as ""individuals over the age of 18 who do not has doubled."" I assume that is meant to read ""over the age of 18 who do not READ has doubled"". 
 
 I believe that this field guide would also benefit from more focus. Rather than focus on the technology of podcasts or audioblogging, I would like to see how a specific podcast functions and demonstrates the way forward. The author does mention one work, ""99% Invisible"", but it is given as an example of the form rather than being the focus of the field guide. 
 
 This follows in the ""Future Factor"" portion of the response. Rather than focus on how the podcast points the way to the future of books, the author instead digresses on an unrelated tangent. While it's certainly interesting information, thoughts on book distribution, government censorship, etc. don't seem to have a place in this particular assignment. 
 
 I believe the primary changes that need to be made are in organization. Focus on a single work, demonstrate how the form is superior (or at least the way forward) and finally why this constitutes the future of the book."
"I may be wrong in this assessment, but I believe that the ""description"" aspect of the assignment was to be less focused on the content of the novel and more on what makes the novel different from other novels. As the author notes, the content itself isn't unique in that sense. I would suggest refocusing the ""description"" on the process of the publication, rather than the content. That way, it would clear-up plenty of space in the ""Future Factor"" section to discuss how this process shows us a way forward in the future of the book."
"I'm not certain the author adequately explains the benefits of the ""lack of borders"". There is mention that ""the visual style of this story goes hand in hand with its format"" but not having read the work I'm not sure what this means, aesthetically. Likewise, ""it takes the act of reading a story and makes it almost into a film strip"" does not indicate why this is necessarily a positive development, or one that can be expanded to other works. 
 
 There is also some confusion that seems contradictory, such as ""some hosting sites have shrunk the pages down to a more ""normal"" size"", suggesting a traditional page layout, yet the author also says, ""it simply could not have been published in the old media"". A few lines clarifying this apparent contradiction would be helpful. 
 
 Overall, a focus on the effect of this borderless approach with this book, as well as ideas on how it could be beneficial in the future would be helpful."
"In this case, the author focuses on a technology, rather than a specific work. I believe that to properly fulfill the assignment, the guide should be refocused on a particular work that uses Tumblr as the medium, and use examples from that work to demonstrate how Tumblr is different from other mediums. While one author is mentioned as an example, the field guide would be stronger if it were focused on the work, rather than the technology."
"I have very few criticisms of this work. Perhaps it would be beneficial to distinguish between these sorts of websites and an ""ordinary"" website dedicated to a particular piece of fiction. For example, would the myriad of fan-made websites be considered a part of this expansion of the book, or would it be limited to author-run websites?"
"My only critiques are grammatical ones. In your summary you saidpeople can subscribe to as many different ones to follow and read each entry. You have a strong voice throughout your entry, however this sentence feels awkward and could be rearranged so I it feels more cohesive with the rest of the entry. 
 
 Then, in your description, when you saidto skydive out of a plain, plain should be plane. 
 
 Thats all I got :) great job!"
"My only critique is a grammatical one. In the description when you saidA animated and interactive telling of the books, a should be an. 
 
 Thats it :) great job!"
"Um...well...I really don't have much. What can I say, you did a great job. I guess you could give us a quick line describing what the story is about. I think that could make your description stronger."
"Your description was excellent, but I feel that your argument as to why this should be considered afuture book was lacking. To me it felt as if you were defending it against modern technology instead of embracing it as part of our future and where books are going. I think if you removed these sentences it might help alleviate that defensive stance:Scanimation books are impossible to recreate in digital format. If one was to do so, it would entirely devalue the retro novelty and simply exist as crude animation, like an animated gif.""
 
 
 
 Also, in your description, when you said11 Iconic Scenes from a Galax Far, Far Away¦ Galax should be Galaxy."
"Your summary is very unclear. Even in your description I wasn't entirely sure where you were headed. I didn't fully understand what your entry was about until I read the ""Future Factor"" section. Creating a clear summary and immediately describing what this ""Future Book"" actually is will strengthen your whole assignment tremendously."
"I thought the field draft was well written, however in terms of the book's future factor I would like to know more about why other books would follow suit. It is clearly stated what makes the book different now, but what makes it special enough to be the future for other books?"
I feel the student's entry for future factor could do without the first three sentences. The student could easily use more examples of how the podcast is increasingly popular and what advances it is already making as well as why it will be more popular later.
"When reading the future factor I would like to know more about why this type of format is a natural progression. Would certain people not find it tedious? It is true that it may be a richer experience for those who are willing to try, but in all honesty how many people are willing to work and read? We live in an age where easy access and fun at your fingertips is most popular. So what makes this book accessible and how will other books follow?"
"Perhaps the student could explain why it would be a good idea for Emily C. to have her work only accessible online. The student has done a great job explaining why it was savvy for Emil C. to use her online resources, but why not also publish in print? What about people who are still reading physical books and struggle with the digital age? How will authors like Emily C. ease the people drifting behind into the future of e-books and online videos?"
I think the references to Nelson and Coupland were unnecessary. I think Alice covered all your bases on this assignment.
"But will the blog replace the book? I see them co-existing as they do presently, but unless blogs progress in some way, I am not seeing the ""future book"" part."
Description was strong. Many good points and examples. I listen to podcasts often while working myself.
"Future factor was weak. Reference to Konstantinou seemed only tangentially related. You seems do be saying podcasts are the future because publishing might be shut down...? Are you saying in the future, there will be no blogs? If there is no internet, how are the podcasts disseminated? I'm sorry, I was confused by this."
"Future Factor was strong, but it did not match Summary and Description. Future Factor section had a great idea for future book format and good points about how fast technology is moving."
Is the answer documentary films or a book with digital capabilities? You answered the assignment with two different forms. I would say stick with the latter and re-write #1 & #2.
"Not sure how this is the future if it is now...? Also, can it be read on a phone or is size sometimes still a consideration for this format?"
"The persepective in section 2 confused me a little bit. It was almost more like a sales pitch or business case from the IDEO company than a field guide entry. I think the field guide entry should contain observations from an outside observer. I would remove the sense that the author has some sort of insight into the IDEO company motives for creating the programs and provide a more in-depth description of how the interface between the programs works.
 
 
 
 Section 3 could also use more objectivity. It reads like one who is partial to this particular program."
This entry highlights a very recent innovation. The case for this being futuristic is easy to make. I don't think it is a stretch to anticipate an increase in supporting content for novels. I agree that we will very likely see more of this type of interactive website in the future.
"My only criticism of this is that I would like the focus to be aimed more closely at the actual books hosted on Pottermore. The focus of the assignment should be specifically what constitutes the future of the book. The format of the books on Pottermore may be the way of the future. Maybe someday all books will be hosted on a centralized website, like libraries of the future, with interactive material being an expected requirement."
This entry falls short in providing an actual example. Describing all ebooks is too generic for a field guide. I would pick one and explain why the ebook is the future of books through the description of a particular example.
This entry falls short in providing an actual example of this particular hybrid ebook. I think a field guide should focus on one example and describe the execution in detail.
"I loved this entry. It is hard to come up with comments here; however, if I was to try to make an argument for the future factor of audio books I would cite the increase in handheld smart phone devices, blue tooth car interfaces, and other technological advancements which make audio books easier to consume.
 
 
 
 I would be very surprised if there wasn't readily available data regarding a correlation between increase in tablets and audio book popularity."
"This entry could focus a little bit more on the history of the book, and how e-readers fall into the development of the book. Furthermore, the author could touch on the ways in which people interact with e-readers today."
"The description section could be a little bit longer. After reading it, I was still wanted to know more. I would also discuss the history of children's book, and how they have progressed briefly that way there is a comparison with the future."
"This entry could delve into the history of the book, and how this is represents the future of the book. The assignment called for what happens in 1000 to 5000 years, so perhaps a more complete picture of what makes this ""futuristic"" is necessary."
"The summary of the book could be a little more specific. What formats are you talking about? The description section, while it is well-written, seems out of place for this assignment. The only futuristic thing about this book seems to be the plot line, until it is explained that it is a crowdsourced book. The author could speak a lot more to the futuristic elements of that, as oppose to a summary of the book."
"This entry could do more to find the futuristic nature of the book. Specifically, the line, ""This additional element of art makes the book futuristic as well,"" doesn't really make sense because art has been incorporated in books for thousands of years. What/how will we be living that makes this book so applicable to the future?"
"There are quite a few editing errors that need to be made throughout the draft. A close reading should catch them. Otherwise, this site sounds like an interesting website for those interested in the Harry Potter series."
"There are some minor editing errors that should be seen on a slow re-reading of the entry. Additionally, I was a little bit confused on the concept of scanimation. The author of the entry gives a comparison but I find myself still struggling to see the futuristic qualities of the book. The book sounds like it fits the bill to a futuristic book but also just sounds like a picture a book. Perhaps a little more explanation of scanimation would explain the book better."
"This entry does really great at explaining hybrid books and how they are a potential future book type. However, this wasn't the assignment. There isn't a clearly chosen book that is being described just an idea of a book type/genre."
This entry doesn't describe an actual book. It merely covers the idea of what a successful future book would look like. The assignment was to find a book that speaks towards the future and describe it's merits as a future book. This entry doesn't do this at all.
The problem that had me questioning whether it would work as an entry was the fact that two of the three products were things that surrounded and enhanced the use of a book or ebook. I might focus on the last company(?) that actually altered the way we would read books.
"The strength in this entry is the third section which explains the ""future factor"". While the actual product might not interest me completely, the explanation as to how it represents how we as readers can interact with a story in different ways made me want to check this story out to at least experience the different mediums. 
 
 This entry meets the challenge of the assignment because it provides us with an actual product that is being used by authors and readers today, but is only a glimpse into what is possible in this new technology."
The formatting is a little bit confusing. I could not tell if there were parts that were quotes from the actual links provided.
There are a few grammatical errors in the entry that caused me to have to reread the sentence.
"This entry falls short in two ways. First is a summary and description. I was confused for almost all the post as to what reddit is. Even once I followed the link, I was unsure as to what exactly its function is. There needs to be a more concise explanation as to what it is.
 
 The second way is in its contempt of the book. There are people who will more than likely be offended by how callously the author has decided to write of the importance of books. Maybe by explaining why they think reddit will replace physical books and bookstores, the reader will have better insight as to why the thought is replacement versus growing alongside them."
This entry falls a bit short in the summary section. I think it might be the grammar in the first sentence that throws me a bit off as to what the actual product is. This is better described in the second section and there is a moment where the concept is clarified in my mind as a reader.
"This entry is not for something that I think everyone can relate to, nor is it something that I think everyone would be interested. I do believe that this is an example of a future book, but I think this entry falls short in every other aspect. I appreciate the fact that this is a more personal example, but I don't think it fits the assignment.
 
 
 
 I think that this can be improved by choosing a topic that everyone can relate to. This is a narrow topic of an example of a future book for one individual, but not for everyone. In this scenario I'm still seeing people having to go out and buy books instead of having easier access to them like ebooks."
"If anything, I felt like this could have used more detail in order to make it a little bit longer. The length and the voice of the entry didn't seem to go hand in hand. I felt the passion that was coming through in the writing, but then it ended before I wanted to."
"I really wanted to see pictures! I loved the description of the book itself, but I wanted to actually see something instead of just reading about the aesthetics of the book. Also, this definitely needs a more concrete title. The title seems as if this was submitted on accident or out of confusion. Also, please remove ""the subject of this entry"" because that is self-explanatory."
"I think a way to really improve this would be to include videos in this entry. This field guide is an online field guide, so it only makes sense to provide links to videos that would help show how documentaries will be the future of the book. 
 
 
 
 ""Take for example"" in the summary doesn't fit with the rest of the assignment, it is self-explanatory. Also, choose what you want your focus to be on- do you want it on ""Babies"" or on documentaries as a whole? If you choose to focus more on ""Babies"", then include it in your conclusion of how this is a future book. If you choose to focus on documentaries on a whole, then I would omit the reference to ""Babies"" and include clips from different documentaries to prove your point."
"Because the programs are very unique and many readers could be unfamiliar with their concepts I feel that the first two programs, Nelson and Coupland could have benefitted from an expanded description. I understand that the limited word space requires succinct phrasing, and the current descriptions do a fine job of describing the programs actual functions, but specific examples of something a reader could do while using the app (instead of just describing general functions) and how it would benefit the reader might have clarified the apps purpose and place in the future of the book, making the description a bit easier to understand, especially to those who are unfamiliar with the programs."
"While I like the ideas and direction of the ""future book"" entry, I think it would benefit from a slightly stronger focus on how this can shape the direction of books and readership. The author mentions that this idea could be applied to other books and other genres, it would be worth it to consider how one could do so, how could authors make the interaction for books uniquely individual like Rowling did, and what will that do for reading - will being able to participate in such and interactive and immersive world drastically change how people read? There are several interesting and unique applications this type of site has to books in the future and I think the analysis of the future section could benefit from some slightly deeper analysis to truly convince readers how this could change reading forever."
"I would really have liked to see the author expand the ""asthetics"" portion of the description section. The general descriptions of what users can accomplish on Pottermore is direct and well written, but I think those not familiar with the site would be more intrigued if the author were to mention what the site looks like, how its set up (use of the sorting hat and the house systems with quizzes and games, common rooms to interact with other users in, the easter eggs in the interactive sections of the novels etc). This set-up is part of the large appeal of Pottermore and is crucial to it's success as an interactive site, so I feel that some attention does need to be given to it's physical appearance and practical uses in the description section."
"While the description of the types of fonts and formats is well presented and well reasoned, if feel including more detail of just how the use of those tools effects the emotional response/connection to the work of the reader would have helped sell the appeal of this type of book more. By just focusing on the detailed and complex uses of the font and format (while informative, important and well done in the original post) the book can come off as daunting or confusing, which may work for some readers, but in general feels like a hard sell to get people interested. By incorporating how those techniques create a unique and intriguing experience for the reader however, and why that experience of House of Leaves is unique, people might be far more willing to go into the book with an open mind and spirit and not be turned off to the idea of this type of media in general."
"Unless I read the title of your subject, I would not have understood what you were necessarily writing about, I kept waiting to read which particularblog you were discussing, however, you were speaking generally about blogs as a whole. Possibly bring up an example of a blog group that you have found very useful or interesting so that the reader could be directed to those and they could experience what you are describing. You spoke of tragedies, possibly reference where you read about a child drowning or cancer that struck you so interesting that you mentioned it here."
"The weakness of your paper is that you started off strong regarding Emily C. however finished somewhat generic with discussing an entire realm of futuristic literature. I am conflicted here because I do feel that the information you stated was important (one of the strengths I listed above) yet, I think you should find a more solid connection with Emilys journey. You mentioned that she was not associated with a publishing company, did she attempt to be published? Was publication a more difficult choice to spreading her story than e-book? I believe the convenience of publication online could be discussed, wherein that is also important to why she most likely decided to go this route, publishing a book is a confusing and long journey, yet the instantpublishing online does the job; thus the reason for so many disappearing bookstores."
"The weakness of your article would be several grammatical errors, however I understood and followed what you were saying with no problem. I think your article could have had more bearing if you described one particular hybrid book."
"The strengths of your Rough Draft are that you explained thoroughly an internet news community to where I did look it up, I had never heard of it before. The problem with the claim that this is ""already the future of the internet"" is that there are so many communities of information, it is sometimes difficult to decipher which carries the most accurate information. However, you could be very right, all the information we now receive is from sources that are not well known, and are put on by anyone, so that is accurate. You did a great job of striking my interest, so, as I said, I did look up your source and I will definitely look at it again for some information."
"The motion does match the description I suppose, although I don't get the sense that the square is walking or running. It honestly just looks like it is tweeking out. The object does change colors though when its speed changes. Aesthetically, I think the program is quite pleasing."
"The description isn't very accurate because it seems that the walker mostly runs at the same speed. I mostly see green squares of where the walker was, but every once and awhile i'll see a red one. The colors don't seem to clearly show a difference in speed for me. The walker seems to mostly be walking the whole time instead of running."
"Yes, the motion does the description of the behavior of Question 2. The ""bird"" does fall blue, and then flies and goes green. However, the motion is not contained in the window, so instead of falling to the ground, it's a loop of the ""bird"" falling."
"Yes, the motion matches. But I am not sure what ""moves East"" means; it appears to move in a random direction when it tries to fly. But the way that the majority of the distance traveled while falling is straight down with only small variation is realistic for a free fall."
"The movement more or less matches the description, although it seems this person is stuck walking in a VERY crowded area. Maybe Time Square."
"Good job. The walker matches the description pretty well. I think it's interesting that the rectangle can only move in four directions rather than diagonally as well. It wasn't noticeable at first, but it's different from the class example. I also like the color changes."
"The description does match the behavior, but I find it hard to see it as a rocket. When the rocket teleports back the bottom and changes color it seems like it is a separate object. If the the rocket were to bounce of the walls I think the piece would make more sense."
"I think the description of your sketch is pretty accurate. It reminds me of fireworks rather than rockets, with all that changing colors. However, the only thing that threw me off was the mousePressed action. When I click on the screen, the trail disappears, and it doesn't seem like a rocket/fireworks anymore. Other than that, good job on the sketch!"
"It basically does. Though, there's not food. :/
 
 
 
 
 
 Also, I noticed that there was nothing to keep them from going outside of the window."
The description matches the general behavior of the sketch although I think there could have been more details. In addition to their description the butterflies were changing color and leaving a trail.
"It matches. Once the program starts to run, the walker starts to walk towards the bottom-left corner, kinda staggered. But it's not clear if the robot, after reaching the bottom-left corner, stops at that particular position or just moves out side of the window."
"Yes it does, however I think it's Elvis ghost moving southwest because it looks very faint/ghostly the way it moves, but I loved the way that they described the movement. It moves southwest because of (-2, 1) in their code making it take the quickest exit instead of using other ""routes"" or coordinates. It also has that jumpy/zig-zag movement because it randomly jumps between (+/- 4 pixels left; +/- 2 pixels down)."
"The description of the sketch accurately describes the motion of the object. I feel it's ironic though that the Rumba leaves behind a trail of ""paint"" instead of cleaning."
"I do recognize the rumba motion. It's a little bit too slow for demonstration purposes, but it's pretty accurate. Good job."
The motion does match the description very well as it does seem to mimic two painters competing to color one canvas. They do walk extremely fast which makes the dashing of the bright guy a bit hard to see but you can tell that it is there and more prominent than the sad painter.
"Yep. Sometimes the walkers move so fast they are a bit hard to follow, but their behavior matches the description."
"Yes, the motion matches the description. The rectangle moves but stays within a confined area at the center of the screen. After a period of time it begins to move randomly outside of that area. The color changes from a light to dark red while trapped, then from a light to dark cyan when free. It could have been programmed to continue walking randomly on an infinite loop once free, instead of stopping or moving outside the screen."
"The motion does match the description, but the description seems a little vague. It does speed up and slow down like the author describes. The animation is also a bit boring to look at. Don't be afraid to add color."
I cant really see that its speeding up or slowing down. You said you wanted it to pop up on the other side of the window if it went out of bound and it did do that.
For the most part yes because the rectangles seem to speed off after some time but then tend to cluster for a bit as well.
"The motion of the sketch is as described in question 2. The rectangle draws itself a couple of times around on the screen and skips to the middle of the screen then repeats again. However, what the description says about the duration of each behavior is a bit off by a couple of seconds. The rectangle moves around for about 1 to 2 seconds and then draws in the middle of the screen for less than 1 second."
"I sort of see it. It's very quick on how it reacted to seeing a celebrity, but it seems calm most of the time. It looks like the walker object continues going in random directions and it doesn't head back to its cosy little area."
"The motion perfectly matched what was written in the second question. The fly changes states every 2.5 seconds, and it has the four different actions. The only thing is that it wasn't a rectangle, but as the student wrote, the ellipse just looks better."
Yes it does. The fly seems to move in random patterns every few seconds and has several different behaviors.
"The description fits the behavior, for the most part; it does resemble lighting in slow motion. Though, it does not really look like it was changing color on my screen."
"The motion is similar to the way it is described in the description. The squares do move similarly to a lightning bolt, although I don't actually see the color changing like the author suggests. It's also a little weird to say it's repeatedly trying to hit the ground. That illustration of the animation seems a little forced."
"The walker matches the description, but seems almost identical to the example given in class that had the walker tend to travel right. The only difference in the actual movement is that instead of wrapping the screen cleanly, there is a 400 pixel gap that the walker won't travel. Also, you do not describe how you coded any of it, so it appears that you just took the class example and made a few minor aesthetic changes."
"it does. What I would change about it, though, is that I would reset the squares on random points of the width as well. This is because when life sets you back, it can either be a little or a lot. Also because after a while, one side of the screen is left blank, making it look kind of lopsided. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 P.S. When I played it at first, it shaped out would looked like a running fox with a flaming tail. Thought that was cool."
"Umm, how does that describe the behavior of the walker object? This isn't supposed to be an artists statement but a description of the behavior of your walker object by using some behavior that is found in the natural world or described through a character of some kind. The Sporadic adjective does kinda work since the movement seems random, but I would really try to make your object link to something in life besides a square."
"The motion fits the description in terms of it moving wild and sporadically, however, your description seems a little vague or open for interpretation. It might be a bit of a stretch to say the motion mimics us fighting for what we want."
It kind of looks like it. It is just really hard for me to get past that they are just squares(or rectangles). But it does what it was supposed to do.
"I do not believe the motion matches the description. Perhaps the speed needs to be decreased, it is not visible when the rectangle is standing still to save energy - there seems to always be movement. However, I do notice when the rectangle is moved 30 units away from a point."
The description and behavior definitely match though there isn't really a story behind it. Maybe the spiral represents a bug flying in a spiral towards the screen but then dies cause it hit the screen. However I really love the coding you did for this. It looks beautiful.
"Your description of what is occurring is not done in the way that was asked. You did describe it correctly, but just not as a character in a movie. However, the creating of spirals is really cool and entertaining to watch."
"Description and actual sketch look to be matching, but it's not described as if it was a character in a movie.
 
 This is also a really cool design. Great job!"
"I really like the creativity in the description. I think the description was made to fit the animation, but I feel it works here. The animation does display the erratic behavior of the scenario you presented. Visually, it is very fun, although the rapid switching between grays can be a little displeasing to watch."
"The sketch was quite unexpected. I had expected a large rectangle travelling down the screen and found one that was small and nearly transparent. However, I like how well it matches the actions of a parachute explorer. The response in question 2 matches the behavior of the rectangle as like that of the parachute explorer, giving me a better sense of what is happening on the screen."
"Simple and straight to the point, this patch was fun and easy to use. The primary sound was simple but slightly annoying (perhaps like a good 'no' sound should be. The surprise of the 'yay' when I found the yes key was extremely pleasing and the the fireworks certainly added a cool surprise."
"Simple structure but effective, the added graphics were great but unexpected because they had not come up in class as an option within the creative process of this software. Seems like I am learning a lot about what the possibilities for more user friendly interface design. My only critic was that the buttons at the bottom could have been lined up more symmetrically."
"The header is very creative, presenting the challenge of attempting to locate the good key. It presents a nice, inviting title and lays out the challenge before you while still being minimal. The master sound button is a great idea, saving the viewer a little time by not having to scroll down and switch each individual sound button on. The logistic part of the patch, though, is much the same as we were presented in class, with a little extra fuddle and detracting clunkiness included."
"Once the master sound button has been toggled to active the process becomes as simple as pressing different keyboard buttons until the right one has been pressed.; in this case it is ""P"". The sounds are clear in relaying to the user the information of the keyboard button, good or bad, but seem like stock audio samples that lack originality and are devoid of personality infusion on part of the programmer. The design is nice, but the sounds aren't entertaining to hear repeatedly, so after two/three times, I stopped the program."
"The introduction of the header and master audio switch is a novel idea that is aesthetically pleasing and improves immensely the ease with which the viewer can control the program and use it correctly. The presence of the links between the different objects, necessary as they may be, slightly detract from the quality of the header and switch button. The actual working part of the program seems slightly clunky due to the zigzagging wires crossing through one another and the yes/no button signals. The organization of the patch elements and including more novel sounds will make the patch perfect."
"While I was using this patch, I was very confused by the good key and bad key sounds. The sound for the bad key element did not sound as negative as I would want it to be. The good key element, with the sound being a bell ringing, was a good choice for determining what the good key was but, the choice for the bad keys was questionable with it being just a simple drum hit."
"The patch is very simple to use, but overall not very user friendly. For example, in order for the patch to work the user must load the clips and then turn on the sound. Adding some comments would help the user know what to do. PS! Thanks for not using the most annoying failure sound!! A lot of other patches use really annoying failure sounds and, since you end up hearing it over and over it gets really annoying. So thanks for using something that's not horrible!"
"There is nothing technically wrong with the patch, however, the patch only needs one sound control, you don't need a second exdac object."
"It has a logical flow, but there are two ending speakers that it can lead to. This could have been simplified. There is only one comments, and it is not specific enough if the person is unfamiliar with the program."
It is very simple and not particularly interesting in any way. I am somewhat bored by the simple sounds.
"There are two ending speakers/end points. This could have been simplified to making it only one speaker. 
 
 
 
 They could have left in the comments what key number 100 is."
"The patch feels simple and clean, seemingly trying to be easily understood rather than technically efficient."
"The patch uses two different sfplay~ objects, one for success and one for failure, which makes the patch look easier to understand even if not as technically efficient. I've learned that simplicity can come from making it technically less simple, although it's not surprising or exciting. I am not sure what could have been done better."
My experience with the patch is that it's very goofy. It was difficult to find the key because it wasn't a letter. So I just pressed every key till I could find it.
"No, while the assignment was very organized and clean, they didn't really do anything exciting. I didn't learn anything from it. They couldve added extra sounds to make it better."
"Simple coding like in class, nothing different other than the sound files and the correct key. The comments on the side somewhat gave away the correct key though. I mean, I know it was there for the coder's purpose but for someone who did not know and was trying to figure it out, I would have renamed the sound files to something more incognito as well as the comment."
The folder wasn't labeled so I had to open it to see who files I was looking at. The patch was very simple and clean. There are a couple of toggles that I didn't see the purpose for.
I found the coding to be basically the same as shown in class. The two extra switches I thought maybe could have been removed. The sound was original as well.
When getting the right key it plays a sound very similar but more inviting then when hitting the wrong key.
The bad key has that weird ambient noise and good key is more like an electronic music tone.
"This patch is another short and simple patch but i feel like it needs more room to be able to see more clearly, since it is a short assignment it does not hurt to spread them out a bit more."
The program worked perfectly and it was interesting to hear different sounds and nothing repetitive. All they have to do is spread their projects out more in future projects.
"When running the patch, I couldn't get the sounds to play unless I clicked the ""ezdac"" object. This may be a Max thing though, so I wouldn't discredit the creator for it. Prior to critiquing, I had been listening to music, so when the evil laugh played, I actually jumped a little in my seat because it was so loud. I got a laugh out of it, and smiled fondly when I found the right key and recognized the Beavis and Butthead(or what I assumed them to be) laughs. The sounds are goofy with a touch of terror that still has my heart pumping a bit from the surprise. One thing is for sure, I'll be turning my sound down a bit when moving on to the next critique."
"The patch was pretty standard in terms of technical setup. It followed the tutorial correctly. As mentioned above, the maniacal laugh was pretty surprising. I cant imagine what people with headphones might have done. The sounds chosen did get a bit annoying after multiple key presses, so using multiple laugh tracks might help with the monotony that tends to occur after multiple attempts. In the future I might suggest labeling your files with your name or some kind of identifier - especially if an instructor is going to be looking at it."
"I like the simple layout and the description used to navigate the user into understanding the patch and what it does. They approached it the same way we approached it in class whereas one key is good, and the other key is bad. They could have made more good keys."
"When I first hit a ""wrong"" key, I thought I'd hit a ""right"" one, in that the sound of the evil laugh seemed so much more final than the Bevis and Butthead one. The whole thing felt a little goofy, but that's to be expected in a design that's all laughs."
"The whole thing was incredibly straightforward. I'd have preferred something a little more out of the box, particularly when we were given some degree of freedom. It works exactly how it was assigned, and I feel it's a little boring."
"The ""yes"" key wasn't a letter, but a number key, which I thought was interesting."
The patch looks similar to the patch made in class. It feels generic.
"It feels like the 'no' feedback sound is too long and drawn out, yet the 'yes' sound is great and entertaining. It leads to a really annoying experience until I get the right key."
"This student approached the assignment seemingly to complete it without adding anything new or special, so there is nothing surprising or exciting. I didn't learn anything, as it wasn't unique compared to what we have done in class. It's hard to say what could have been done better since we haven't learned much in class."
The patch was neat and organized. But a few of the pieces like the buttons didn't need to be there.
The buzzer sound for hitting the wrong key was really loud and annoying to hear over and over again.
"Technically, the patch worked perfectly, but there was nothing exciting about it."
"It's a very simple lay out. Very bare bones, and minimalistic. No real explanations to what everything does, outside of the 'good' and 'bad' buttons, but the path to each part if pretty easy to figure out."
"There was some key hunting, and the 'no' sound, which was from Sonic, was a little grating to the ears after a while because of how loud it was being played. The 'yes' sound highly amused me, the victory sound from any given Final Fantasy game. It did feel like a victory after finally finding the 'good' key. It was a nice experience overall."
"Technically, it wasn't anything complicated, and nothing experimental about it. Because of how simple it was, I didn't learn anything new and nothing jumped out at me. Which is fine since the path to each part was laid out to where it should be. Maybe adding a level meter in just to give the user an idea of how loud everything is, and possibly making sure before using a sound that it's not too loud for the user. Other than that, it was a pretty good patch."
the victory sound was a bit too long. but i felt like i watching a movie intro or playing a game
it was pretty simple only thing i would have done differently would be shortening the victory sound file
"The bad key sound is extremely annoying so it really makes you want to find the right button quickly. I also liked how the good key's sound went on for a rather long time. It gave me a sort of Super Mario feel, similar to when the game is beaten and the credits start to roll."
They didn't do anything exciting or surprising but they made the patch as simplistic as possible and I almost think that's better than any extra elements. It makes it so the patch is very easy to read and the user can understand everything that's taking place.
"The failure sound is really annoying, I suppose that it makes the user more motivated to find the success sound, but the game requires hearing the fail sound over and over. It would be better if it was a softer, shorter, less annoying sound, or had volume controls so I don't have to endure it."
"This patch is very simple and easy to understand, but it isn't very user friendly. Adding a few comments to tell the user to load the sample and turn on the sound, for example, would make the patch easier for the user."
"The bad key is bad indeed, it makes you want to hurry and find the good key. Now the good key is rewarding, I do believe it is from a video game and I cannot recall which but hearing it makes me feel as though i just beat an intense level of some sorts."
"Surprised to see something so simple, was expecting something a little more elaborate. In general it was aesthetically clean and pleasing."
"Very easy to use and the instructions in the information box made it clear as to what to expect. The sounds worked well, somewhat goofy but entertaining. Generally effective even though slightly over simplistic."
"Seems as if they recreated the very minimum technicality needed to fulfill the requirements of this projects, fortunately the sounds were entertaining. After looking at the sub patch I realize that there was a bit more thought put into than I realized. Appreciated being able to go in and look at the inner workings of the project. May have been fun to have some other sounds included. Always learning, realize I am going to have to up the ante next time!"
"I had trouble figuring out what I was supposed to do. The directions were a little too cryptic for me, and while I might just be too new at Max, I feel like the average beginner might have been as confused as I was. The sounds were kind of hard to understand as well. I could barely tell what either of them were saying - if it hadn't been for the note, I don't think I would have made out the ""amen"" correct key sound."
"I learned how to select multiple keys/values using the select object, which was something I was trying to do when creating my patch, and for some reason I just couldn't get it to work. Despite my confusion, I think this person did a pretty good job on the assignment. They achieved something completely unique to what I have seen so far. My one suggestion would be to find clearer and possibly shorter sounds."
"I think that the sound quality is a little bit poor, so I can hear a lot of noise. The style of the music isn't in my area of interest, but I think it's pretty cool."
0
It seems like an advanced form of patch because i did not quite understand how to get it to work. It says that the sound file is amen and in order to play it you have to from a new word from the word amen. It is a bit confusing.
I eventually got it to work after reading the instructions carefully but overall the patch itself looks short at a glance and there is a sub patch that actually does all of the work in it and i think that is pretty fancy.
"I cant get the sound to load at all. I dont know if the problem is on my end, but the last patch worked for me."
Couldnt get it to work.
"The patch looks well organized in terms of visually clean, the connectivity of the patch is very sharp and visually appealing. The terms associated with the yes, patch are sounds that would be an obvious strong indication of the, positive, ""yes"" or negative ""no""keys. Prior to interacting with the program I couldn't actually see the speaker connected to the rest of the model or the meter."
"The functionality is simple to use, which is great. There was a voice recording of the word hallelujah and a voice recording of word your wrong. Even when I had my volume on high they were still hard to hear, and the word, ""your wrong"" was very hard to make out. I think the simplicity of the words chosen is good because it is obvious as it relates to this project. I feel the user experience would be straight forward in terms of the literal, ""good key/bad key"" assignment."
"Technically the patching looks fine. It looks like the assignment was followed exactly, the only thing I did not see was the meter. I did not see anything out of the norm in terms of a new feature or function that was not assigned. I really do like the visual aesthetics were very appealing. I did not learn anything new from the way the programming was completed. I think would could have possible been improved was just the recording sound of the wave files, they were just really low."
"It is cute and funny. I like that the bad key sound is ""aint nobody got time for this"" and that when you find the ""good key"" it rewards you with a strongyea!. The sounds were very fast and clipped very tight. It made it feel abrupt."
The first thing I noticed was there were no comment boxes. The coding was not complicated but instead met the minimum requirement and was straight forward.
I figured out how to open finally!!! Catchy recordings
lThis is the basic minimum nothing was done beyond the tutorial
"It is small and compressed, which I like, but the opening window was very large. It it clean and well placed, easy on the eyes. However, there are no comments, which would make it difficult to follow."
"I think you did a good jobs, and also picked a really impressive music, however I think that you might be able to try something more advance or more creative."
"Feel very simple to use, the only thing was the volume control has a setting so at first even when I turned the speaker on I couldn't hear it. After a little time I was able to figure it out."
It felt rather complicated and guideless.
"It felt confusing due to the lack of directions on the sound bar. With that, it lead to the patch being rather complex."
"The presentation is very plain, and looks like they didn't customize it. It is kind of symmetrical, but it looks like they finished it and didn't experiment."
The sounds didn't work for me at first and I had to mess with the live.gain~ function before it made any noise. The actual audio clips were nice and soothing.
"They used the live.gain~ operation, which I was unfamiliar with, so it's cool that they tried something different. But it didn't play sound at first which is basically all it needs to do. They are also the first person who didn't have the YES key blatantly showing, so that's great."
"This is another bare bones basically and neatly structured patch. If they wanted to do more they could have used background colors, made the key a bit more difficult to find with key combinations, and other slightly more complicated additions to the game."
i couldn't get it to work with keyboard buttons just the on screen buttons but i liked it still and the sounds were simple yet effective
only thing i would change would be to get it to work by pressing keyboard buttons
"It looks like there is no actual selection operator for the good key or bad key. There are comments however but they didn't seem to relate to the content of the patch. My question is: were they trying to use the MATCH object, but didn't use it successfully?"
"Did not work. There was no operator to select a good or bad key. The wav files were pleasant to listen to, a soft ""hello"" and ""goodbye"" with a very nice voice. It made me want to use the patch but I could only press the open operator to make the patch play a sound."
"Not adequate, extra simple patch and concept but it still did not work."
The patch looks well organized though I am not entirely sure the purpose of the boxes that say what is.. and awkward. It is easy to understand the flow of the code.
"I was not able to make any sounds happen, and I did not see a select function used so the program seems to be struggling to complete the required code. It is easy to see where I am typing, however."
"It was fairly straight forward so I did not learn anything new in the coding. I think to do this better the author could have added the select message to operate the program to make sound. I think the clarity was well accomplished, and in the future they can focus on being more technically intense."
I could not get the sound to work with the keyboard. Only by pushing the open buttons on the patch. I am not sure if this is a problem on my end though.
Couldn't get it to work properly.
"It looks very basic, much like mine."
I could not get the keys to trigger sounds.
"They did the basic requirement, but I was unable to trigger the actual sounds."
The patch looks nice but with a few extraneous pieces. Unfortunately there is a note telling me exactly which key is the right one so I didn't have to look for it. It kind of defeats the purpose of this patch.
"The sounds were unimpressive. They are just two random noises. They don't feel ""right"" or ""wrong"". If I didn't know what the patch was supposed to do, I wouldn't even know if I had hit the correct key because the sounds are just random, no good or bad feeling to them."
"Technically, the patch was perfect. Though there was nothing original about it except the sounds, it did what the assignment asked."
"Using the patch, I didn't ever feel like it wasn't working well, however, I was not really engaged. I didn't truly enjoy searching for the ""good key"" because the sound font didn't draw in my interest. This lead to a one-dimensional experience as in, I was just observing the functionality of the patch."
"The coding assignment was very similar to the screencast. The one exception being that they placed buttons before the 'open' messages. For someone who was unfamiliar with Max or any kind of code, I felt it enhanced the patch from a visual aesthetic and also let the user clearly see what the patch was doing. I think that this was where I was forced to wrap my mind around something. Some could argue that the buttons are unnecessary and it might have a pure simplicity without them."
"It looks and feels a bit complicated, as if there is too much going on the screen at once."
"The student added in an extra tool for showing the audio level, yet besides that, there is nothing surprising or exciting. It seems that they tried to add more to it, even with the little we have learned in class. It's hard to say what could have been done better."
"I really like how things are laid out in this patch, it is pleasant to look at. They did show the winning key however, which doesn't make the game much 'fun'. There are some added functions like the meters which give the patch more personality."
"I think you did a good jobs, and also picked a really funny music. The most impressive thing in your project is a decibel meter to measure the sound, however I think that you might be able to do something more creative."
"Aside from the sounds and extra meter, I'd say this patch was pretty run of the mill. I didn't really see a use for the extra meter, but it did add a little extra visual component to the project. One thing I think could be improved is that there was a little extra length of ""noise"" at the end of the yes soundbite and that probably could have been trimmed off."
"It's amusing that they used the traditional mac error sound and the other sound for the correct key press was generally pleasing. It feels pretty easy to use, mildly aesthetically and audibly pleasing and neatly organized. It gives a pretty good experience, but this game gets old pretty quickly after you've played it a handful of times."
Nothing very exciting or surprising was noticed in this project since all elements of the assignment were similar to the instructor's design.
"The patch was simple, one ""yes"" key."
Looks like it could be tighter/organized slightly more.
At the moment I cannot hear the sound files of any of the programs because I am not on a Mac I think. Patch appears to be working correctly based on the buttons lighting up.
One of the sounds was funny it made me chuckle but the no sound was a simple no which i would of preferred it to make another sound other than the obvious no or incorrect try again.
They approached the coding assignment very typically. The patch looks similar to the tutorial done in class. They added the meter for extra flare. I did learn that I should have used more comments in my own patch since it can be very confusing without them.
goofy. the sounds used are goofy.
"abrupt. Others took time to make the code elegant, long, or truncated, but you could see the connections. Inputs & outputs. None are seen here."
The patch didn't feature a comment telling me which key was the right key. I was forced to push buttons in an attempt to find the right one and the no sound became annoying. I didn't really enjoy the search because of the no sound.
"They seemed to have decided to just stack the codes on top of each other which worked. I think comments would have made for a better experience, so I could test the patch quickly without having to google the right code. I would have added the comment boxes for faster testing."
"Small boxes in general, somewhat squishy and close but it does not take away from the performance of the patch. Same like the one in class."
"Seriously kind of aggrivated. I understand why the coding was so squished now, because the key to activate it was control and the v key. And no, I did not figure it out on my own, I looked it up because I was so annoyed I kept hearing high ho silver awaaaay. When I finally heard the correct sound I was a bit confused, but I guess it makes sense it was talking about teeth and having silver plates on them or else it could cause gingivitis? I don't know, didn't understand that joke.."
"Since it was condensed in size, it definitely took more time to find the right key(S), PLURAL. It was definitely surprising because I literally went down the rows of keys trying to match the numbers. I learned that to be sneaky and troll people, don't show all the connections so that people can get frustrated and slam their keyboard...no I didn't do that.."
"I would have liked more notes and the whole thing just seemed a little crammed together. There's space! Use it! There's also a number box with a -127, and I'm not sure why."
"I only got one of the sounds to trigger - the ""no."" The Ace Ventura sounds were cool and all, but only if it actually works."
"So, the ASCII code for their selected value is 22, but that doesn't actually correspond to a keyboard input, so it didn't actually function in the way I would hope."
"The patch looks very good, and is condensed a lot. But still looks like it took some technical abilities to make."
"Firstly, the sounds are fantastic. The creator expertly utilizes the concept of ""cuteness"". Even though the patch is very simple, the fact that it makes ""human"" sounds gives it an air of humanity."
"The patch is very simple, but the creator could have added a few things to make it easier to the user. Firstly, comments that tell the user to turn on the sound, for example, would make is user friendly. Secondly, adding a few features like the ability to pick the ""success"" key would be a great feature for this patch."
"Looks similar to class example but minus the ""numbers"" box to see exactly what number this was, this made it a bit tougher."
"The sound was sort of boring at first...but then I found the ""yes"" button and it made me laugh for quite a while, good use of the file."
The patch itself gives off a very good feel. It was not as clear as some of the others and at first it looks like they may have missed a step but they just simplified it to the very core.
Simple and not as developed as it could have been. On a positive note it was not intimidating.
"Basic concept, kind of monotonous and it took me while to find the 'yes' key! The redeeming factor was the 'yes' sound was crazy and strange and interesting which made it worth the wait."
Nothing new from what we did in class and they layout could have been a little tidier. May have been cool to add some graphics? A good reminder that we need to push our creativity if we want to come up with something truly original!
"I was not able to get the patch to run. However, the description that was provided makes the patch seem like a very neat idea. I liked that the idea was musical and hope to see something like this that works."
Doesn't look like its going to work.
Couldn't get the code to work. I'm not sure if this is a problem on my end.
Couldn't get it to work.
I could not get your keys to open and play. When I unlocked it to check if they were linked to a file by double clicking on it nothing happened.
"Right off the bat, I noticed that there would be more than two sounds that could possibly be played, and probably some at the same time. No descriptions to how the sounds can be made by each part, but from looking at it one can guess what's going on with it."
"I honestly could not get it to play anything. I can open each .wav file in the folder to find out what I'm supposed to hear, but I can't replicate that in the patch. There also wasn't a level meter, so I had no idea if sounds were actually playing or not, or if there was a problem on my end with my speakers. I really wanted to know if I could play 'Sweet Home Alabama'."
"There was a really cool and neat idea in the patch that somehow along the way didn't come through. I don't know if something had a wrong path, or something. I did see two message boxes before the speaker, so I don't know if that was the problem or not. The idea was exiting, but sadly I couldn't hear it."
I felt like I was in Vegas for a minute.
"nothing out of the ordinary, just the basic patch from the video."
This is perhaps the most basic incarnation of this particular assignment. The sounds are predictable and obvious in their connotation.
"So far this patch is the smallest I've seen. Everything is very condensed which almost makes it look clustered but also gives the patch a sense of unity. It's very clear everything works together and makes the patch seem like a whole thing rather than a bunch of parts working together. This aesthetic is very interesting, I haven't seen it before."
This patch looked a little to clumped together. I think it would look more clear and professional if there was more space in between each of the keys. I also don't see the a button that explains the letter that represents the good key so I'm unsure which key to hit.
"This patcher followed all the right rules and components of this assignment. I still suggest spacing out the buttons/keys to look better and cleaner. In this case, I would also advise on stating which key is the good key for the sake of time for this critique assignment. But it still played the sounds and functioned perfectly."
The sounds are entertaining. It's a bit confusing that the sound is used for both good key and bad key. At first it made me think I had pressed both keys or there was an error in the way it was coded. I then realized the same sound is used within the good key sound as the bad key sound. It's very easy to use and navigate.
I wouldn't use sounds that have such similarities unless you are trying to confuse your audience.
"The experience was OK. The sounds were fairly interesting although it was a little confusing. For some reason I though the wrong key was the right key, but that just may be how I took the sound effect."
"Like I said before, it was done very simply. Which is always good. The simpler the better. However, I kinda would have liked to see comments of some sort. If I had no idea what was going on, I would be incredibly lost. Honestly, I didn't really learn anything new from this patch."
at first glance the patch looked complicated. however the patch notes were helpful.
"I think the patch looks really cool. I learned a few new things like the counter. As I went through it, I thought of ways to make it simpler, but Overall, I think it looks really good. Great Job!"
Before I ran the patch the overall look and feel was very confusing to me at first. I was unsure how it worked together. I have limited experience with Max and this may be my reason for my confusion but I do think it could be a little more cleaned up.
"The patch was pretty entertaining to work with and would be something fun to use for a kid. Although, when I was working with It I was confused with what keys I was pressing to make the different sounds. The sounds weren't necessarily ""good"" or ""bad"" therefore I think the keys I was pressing should have been more straight forward but they felt random."
"I think you did a very good job technically working on this. Although the code was confusing to me, after I played around with the sounds for a while it was easier to see how it works. You also did a good job explaining the changes that you made, making it easier to understand. After looking at your code and the changes made on it from what we did in class, I learned a few new ways to connect the keys and make it so there is multiple ""good keys"" and ""bad Keys""."
"Kind of confusing. It seems as though Tom tried to create two different Good Key Bad Key patches and put them together to form one. It seems that he experimented and tried to create a more advanced, more complex version of what we made in class."
"I'm still a little unclear about how this patch works. Instead of just one ""Good Key"" there are two different ""Good Keys"" which play two different sound files of trains. The ""Bad Keys"" play the sound of 2 more different trains that alternate back and forth every time you hit a bad key. I find this to be rather confusing because all four of the train sounds are very similar to each other and it's hard to comprehend which keys are ""good"" and which keys are ""bad."" In total there are 5 different sound files present in this patch, which I kind of don't understand. I wasn't able to hear the fifth sound, which apparently was a bell that was also supposed to match with a specific key."
"I appreciate the fact that Tom tried to do something different with his project and expand upon what was taught in class, but I do think he could have organized it better and chosen sounds that aren't extremely similar to each other. There is just a lot going on in this patch and I think it should have been simplified."
I'd like it better if things were more organized. I have to look in many different parts of the display box to see what is what.
The sounds are simple and not very entertaining in my opinion. The good key is kind of exciting but runs a bit longer than I'd like it to. The experience I get is just wanting to press many different keys over and over
They approached it exactly as we did in the classroom. I didn't really learn anything from what they did because it's very similar to mine. I would at least organize the different objects.
Looks very simple and similar to the patch shown in class. does not have any notes.
the experience is very simple but it works.
Simple to look at. Nothing different or unusual about the patch. Basically what we learned in class. There were no comments on the patch to let me know what the good key was.
Technically simple. I would have liked an overlap of sound that two speakers would have given the patch. It would have made it more fun to use.
"It is the most difficult experience I ran in to because I could not find key 110 and the author did not tell me which one it was. Granted, if the purpose of the code was to find the key, then the author completed this marvelously. I was also still able to listen to the sounds, and this helped further the appeal."
"They also seemed to follow the pattern laid out in class, without adding anything additional. This completed the assignment but did not go overboard in any way."
"The patch feels identical to the example, as for usage. The sounds for the ""bad"" keys sound like a hi-hat or other cymbal on a drum kit, and the ""good"" key plays a full groove for almost 10 seconds. Overall, it's simple, and does what we wanted it to."
"Like I said before, it is virtually identical to the example from class. I would suggest cleaning up the patch cords and organization of objects a little more."
"The aesthetic look of the patch is appealing and it has all the components with some of the other patches have been missing. The design of the patch is predominantly on a vertical plane, but here is uniformity and it looks balanced with how the components were placed. It looks user friendly and well defined."
"I think the coding was approached very well within the constraints of the assignments, meaning there was no other new or different technical components. However, it looks like they really did master the patch that they did complete. The only improvement I could make is to be more aware of the artist element of design within the patch. For example, the cables connecting the components could be connecting in a way to create more of artist representation of the piece."
Looks very basic.
