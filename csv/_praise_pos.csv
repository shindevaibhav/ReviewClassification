"On the first and third questions they had a pretty solid idea, but question two they failed to put really any effort or real thought into. The first idea could be fleshed out better in terms of how the physical presentation would look like as well as why their idea is important and what the goal of it is.
 
 
 
 1. A very simple midi keyboard program for a computer.
 
 2. Another ipod? 
 
 3. A program that reads color and turns it into music."
"In all of the projects, he or she discusses the use of lasers. Though the projects are very similar in their use of lasers, they are also fairly different ideas. The student made a good effort to expand upon their ideas and give details. They want one project using lasers as a form of data transfer, laser interactive project and another basic max/patch laser project."
"There are definitely three separate ideas proposed, but all based around similar technology: lasers. All seem like pretty solid ideas; one being to make a simple environment where laser are pointed at targets to create musical tones, another using laser signals to beam data between devices, and the last using lasers for a target practice type game."
"The first and third ideas seem most plausible. Combining the two, we could make certain noises when different targets are hit. Expanding on just the third idea, we could make a few different environments for the target simulator. Maybe something as simple as the silhouette targets police use in a shooting range, or as complex as a city street/alley/etc."
"I feel the student elaborated enough to get o good idea of what they are aiming for.
 
 The first idea is to create some kind of musical instrument incorporating lasers.
 
 The second idea is to use lasers to send information to different devices they also stated that some of the technology may need to be further developed.
 
 The last idea is some sort of shooting game with lasers and a projector."
"The glove project is the most interesting project. It is hard to track person's hand moving, I know. But you can develop the idea further. For example, if you can use the glove to remote manipulate some objects. Or even an idea, but I think the introduction video will be awesome."
"Overall, I believe this person put a decent amount of thought into the ideas. Each idea is written vividly and thoroughly. 
 
 The first idea is basically to create a device that generates midi sounds with an arduino and some buttons/knobs. 
 
 The second idea is basically creating remote control soldiers for the use of the army, essentially making military deaths a thing of the past.
 
 The third idea is to create a glove that works with the oculus rift to track hand movements to be translated into the virtual world within the oculus rift."
"Honestly, anything I can think of has already been done. My initial thought was to combine 1 & 3, to make a glove that works like a midi controller. However, that was basically done recently by Imogen Heap. Another idea would be to combine the soldier drone suit and the game controller. Just having a full-body controller for VR systems, but that would take more than a semester."
"This student made a sincere effort in proposing the ideas, as each one feels thought out to the extent that they can be in such a short amount of time. The first idea was to make a midi controller, which seems to require hardware that is simple to make and some programming that this student is not confident in doing. The second idea was to make unmanned robots that function similarly to human beings, allowing soldiers to control one as if it was their own body without the risk of death. The third idea was a glove for virtual reality that can mimic the actions of the player, allowing the player to interact with the virtual world similarly to the real world, potentially with haptic feedback."
"The answers displayed here show that a lot of thought was put into these questions. Everything was answered clearly and concisely, with lots of detail and creativity."
"I'd love to work with the arduino live music control. One thing we could add would be programable visuals with the live music, in order to enhance the live experience. This could be with projection mapping, color recognition, or even animations."
I like the idea of having an app that allows you to interact with a concert you are attending. I also like the idea of having sort of one central app that allows you to research and donate to causes around the world. I think that would be the best bet.
"I would say that ideas 2 and 3 are definitely more focused with and objective, however though I am impressed with idea 1, it explains more of what your skills are rather than an actual particular project such as ""make a video that does X"" or ""compose a song around X ideas"". I got confused at the beginning of 1 because you state that you could build a website but then later make note that you do not have much programming experience, so I am assuming this would be done by some other means like a template website designer and not actually using HTML and CSS."
"Seeing as how this student is very arts based with design, video, and music, I feel we could work well together as I do myself have many artistic qualities (I am also a musician) but I also have some programming experience to work on the more technical level. I think it would be possible to work on some iteration, if not the complete idea, of the third proposed project. We could probably achieve a basic prototype form through the use of Max MSP I would assume. We could blend their experience of live sound and my capacity to finagle Max."
"Overall I felt that the student made a good effort to explain their ideas. 
 
 
 
 1. An unspecified rough app or computer program. 
 
 
 
 2. A series of sensors in bikes and/ or cars that alert drivers/ cyclists to potential collisions. 
 
 
 
 3. An app that the city/ police can use to see where cyclist have had accidents or poor experiences so that changes can be made to prevent future accidents."
"This student is looking to create a prototype of an interface that is beneficial to those who like to ride their bicycles on the road and care about their safety. I think they did clearly propose their motivations and thoughts, being concerned with improving public cycling collisions and allowing some sort of warning system."
I believe that some solid effort was put into this by the student. The ideas were well thought out and put lots of variables into consideration with cycling. Cycling is a largely used mode of transportation so these ideas will most likely be successful.
"I like the idea of simplifying things like routes and safety in cycling. I think we could think up ways on how we could branch out with these ideas or even conjure up some more,"
"You have a great goal, to make cycling safer. If only you wrote down a few more ways to achieve this. A way to report dangers threw an app or something is a great idea. It would give cyclist a voice and push the city to make changes. What other ways can this be done?"
"This student definitely went in depth and was really detailed about what they would do in these situations. I honestly believe they could get a lot done in a week from the first question, do something really awesome and a lot of good from the second question, and continue their project on and make it better in the third answer."
"I could definitely collaborate in making a video or board game with them, creating sketches or doing animation, and I think that would be a lot of fun, especially if it is combined with the other two ideas, into an interactive game, maybe for physical therapy or something. I wouldn't be able to do much with the VR part, but I could definitely help with design."
"1) A quick board/video game
 
 2) NCVR - Virtual Reality that is truly immersive (utilizing all senses)
 
 3) Creating an AI
 
 
 
 It seems like they really put some thought into it, as it all seems to build upon each other. However, the semester idea seems perhaps too ambitious."
"He/she has ideas about the game design are related human body and nervous system. His/her plans and ideas are related each other. Also, he/she has rough design concept and I think he/she has potential energy to develop and realize the system. That is not perfect yet, but it would be great project under his/her plans during this collaboration project. Also, his/her NCVR project is not far away from today."
"I can imagine his/her project would be foundation stone for future project about the NCVR and AI. If he/she meet and collaborate with designers such as a visual, sound, and media installation person, this project would be great interactive gaming system. This project is quite impressive for me."
"I can tell that this student is very passionate about virtual reality, as am I. This NCVR sounds like an excellent idea (albeit a little risky) but it would definitely be the next step in VR. Visuals have been covered by systems such as the Oculus Rift, but that's as far as it goes (to my knowledge)."
"By the look of it, I think we could make a really good VR game together. The ideas and goals are all there, we would just need to work for a long time to reach those goals. Game are a huge part of my life so I could think of lots of ideas on how this project could take off."
Yes they made a effort with their three ideas being. 1. To build a moto-Bike of some sort similar to a moped. 2. To create a water powered system to create energy. 3. To make an interactive environment with lasers and such.
I thing a projection based art project would be cool we could make some sort of projection mapping setup that allowed the laser graffiti to be made on a number of different objects.
I think they thought about what they wanted to do. It was what seemed to be as much elaboration as needed for this type of assignment. It seemed like everything was more or less just an idea and there was nothing that had really been thought of.
"I love the idea of cars running on water. The change to the environment it would make would be spectacular. Also, the laser gun and light graffiti both sound really fun and artistic."
"We could probably make (with a bit of programming knowledge) an awesome game where, as it has been said, draw lines with lasers on a giant projected light wall. The fundamentals seem pretty basic for something that could turn out to be really cool."
"They actually seem to emit a sense of having a clear idea on their heads that may just be much easier to describe with pictures rather than words. i can see their vision, but not much of the whole concept yet."
"Although they made attempts and I think their ideas were in the right direction because the person wanted to tackle larger problems; however, they didn't propose workable ideas."
"I believe that the student made a sincere effort into their answers for ideas 1 and 2, and to a lesser extent idea 3. Idea 2 could have used some more clarification as I am not wholly sure what these group games are, while idea three could use some expanding upon.
 
 
 
 Their one week idea was to create a mini-game that tested the end users reaction time and post their ""score"" on an internet serve, thus allowing players to rank their times.If they were given no time or money limit they would want to construct a world fitness center that both explores the concept of group games that promote healthy fitness as well as having machines/other equipment that help the users stay fit. They are willing to offer prize incentives for working overtime. For their semester goal they wish they wish to be more involved in their gaming company and create several more games for a college student audience that help them with their class studies."
"For your semester project goal, I think you might be onto something. Many freshmen come into college shocked at how different it is in comparison to high school, and thus, take a while to get settled down into their new world. Maybe you could construct a game that helps freshmen college student ""learn the ropes"" if it were to how to survive your college experience. Maybe tailor made to ASU instead of a general college survival guide, you could make games that illustrate how to use Blackboard or Ctitviz, maybe include a 3D map of the school in a racing game that subconsciously teaches you how to get around the school campus."
"This student did a great job at stretching their thinking. There are three ideas present, each with their own unique twist on them due to the limitations of either time or money. The first idea is a game, not sure what platform, that calculates reaction time of the user. It would be awesome to have further discussion on what this could be used for; personally, I see this mini-game being used for competition entertainment between friends. The second idea is a group of games used to encourage a healthy and fit lifestyle by using a reward benefactor to motivate people. The third idea touches briefly on the student's passion to expand their gaming company."
As far as the description of the idea goes it does hit some points. I like the idea of the game for fitness. I'm a little confused about it being an video games or an physical game like sports? I like how it would incorporate on the physical aspect of fitness like using gym equipments for the workout. The incentive on accumulating points is also a great idea. I picture this idea as in the Wii Fit game but not augmented reality? An example on this would be helpful for a visual example.
I would like to work on this project because my idea is about fitness as well. If we can incorporate on kind of campaign about well-fitness and create an event or program that utilize this game I believe this project will be incredible project to work on. If people see there are incentives on exercising and also being fit because the ultimate goal is about fitness and seeing that it is fun to work out they would participate on the event/game.
"Idea 1: a simple game that measures reaction time to different situations, and shows these times against the times of others.
 
 Idea 2: A collection of games that promote exercise and fitness, some of which incorporate gym equipment, all of which are part of a larger businesslike organization.
 
 Idea 3: Expanding an already established gaming company that focuses on college course material.
 
 
 
 This student has clearly-proposed three ideas and has touched on the details and motivations for them."
"The ideas here are fairly well-thought-out. None of these ideas are very detailed, but at this point, they have enough information that can see the thought put into the ideas."
"I like the idea for the graphic design that would get the world excited about helping make earth a better place to be. I have a similar idea that I think could go along this, adding social media capabilities, and getting as many people involved as possible."
"There is a coherent project idea in each answer. 
 
 
 
 1. A set of hand painted images than could be formatted into booklets for special occasions. 
 
 
 
 2. An interactive building facade on a skyscraper that changed base don the people in it or by it that highlighted them in some way. 
 
 
 
 3. A business that creates games that are both educational and entertaining."
"Working on a small game or proof of concept that taught geologic principles through exploration of underground tunnels and caves would be a potential idea. The idea for this is to have students discover different types of rock and geological processes while actually down in the depths of the earth, showing why this information si interesting firsthand."
"I think the student has interesting ideas regarding the exploratory questions of this assignment, but needs to be more specific about their ideas in question 2 and 3. How would the display make the skyscraper building ""less standard""? What are the games that can be played outside of the classroom? 
 
 
 
 His/her three ideas are to create a wedding book of painted stock images, an interactive display of digital arts at the side of a skyscraper, and an educational video games based on a business idea."
"The first idea was a scanable storybook program, that simplifies and makes creating photo albums easy and simple. The second was to create a building that would react to people in, around, and people looking at the building, interacting visually with all of them. The third idea is video game education program, working inside schools and possibly outside. 
 
 
 
 The ideas were sincere but the last idea really could have been explained a bit more, all ideas are good. Especially the building idea, it really makes me wish that existed in a large scale."
"Well working within the education game, you could possible extend the controller of the program into physical space. Using arduino to create physical controllers would be simple and could create a new realm for the game to be played in."
"There are three good ideas present, however not all answers have deeply thought out ideas. I love the ideas but I wish the student would have expanded on their ideas. The first idea is to create a first person shooter game. I like the idea of creating a map/level that can be added to a first person shooter game. It would be awesome to have a game that allowed the game community and its aspiring developers be the creation factor of the maps, levels, and content. The second idea is to build a gaming team to create video games that raise discussion on important topics/issues in the world. These games will also keep the traditional aspect of what a game is. The third idea would be to create an exploration game."
"As I said before, it would be awesome to have a game that allowed the game community and its aspiring developers be the creation factor of the maps, levels, and content. I would love to collaborate and work as the creative/business side of the video game design process. It would be great to work as a team to deliver content to existing games or even new games that promote community driven creation within games. This would give power to the game community, almost like an ultimate sandbox."
"You know what you want to do so the stretching your thinking can be done in the context of your video game. since we are talking about making the world a better place does the game teach the user, inform them, anything other then just entertaining them?"
"As the author mentions, he is a game level designer. So I am interesting in his game level design. It would be fun to explore the key of each level in order to reach the next level. But I have no idea about how to do that. Hope to see your game!"
"I think that you have a few good ideas about what you want to do, however I am a little unclear on both of them. 
 
 
 
 1) For the pistol device that you mentioned in idea 2: Why is it a designed to be pistol like? If you are worried about negligent or improper behavior in a community, why would you shape your device to look like a deadly weapon? Additionally, could you elaborate a little more on what you meant by patrol device? What makes it more or less specialized than a smart phone?
 
 
 
 2) For the mobile app: I too find it interesting to manipulate a mobile device to track social and personal habits. What kind of error proofing will you need to do in order to make sure the mobile app doesn't go off during every quiet situation? Also what kind of habits are you specifically attempting to track? The range of personal and social habits is a pretty broad range."
I think that the student displayed a nicely planned out set of steps that would allow the project to flourished.
"The answer in the first idea is pretty vague. The writer seems more interested in putting down steps for developing an idea rather than actually conceptualizing a project. The second question is more thoroughly thought out and visualized, though there are some privacy and safety questions arising from the idea of a private autonomous, or at least mobile, surveillance system. The third idea is the most feasible, though I would fins it kind of irritating if my phone kept making personal comments about my habits and randomly playing music suddenly when it gets quiet."
"If the student is serious about creating an app, then maybe we could create a storytelling app with a significant visual element, like a web comic but with some interactivity. Maybe a choose your own adventure with dynamic visuals and some animation."
They seemed to make a sincere effort and propose three things. The first being to just simply plan ahead as much as possible. The second was to create a non profit company organization that hires law enforcement that uses patrol devices. The third is to showcase a demo of the idea with a mobile app.
"I like the idea of using patrol devices, but this can be risky since I'm sure they will not be cheap and you have to worry about people messing with or breaking or stealing them. I also like the idea of creating an app as sort of a personal side kick."
I think these ideas are pretty well thought out and practical. The doorknob thing sounds kinda fun. Each of these ideas take the concepts and skills we're developing in DC and applying them in imaginative ways.
I'd love to draw storyboards for this person's Great Wall idea. The idea of displaying cultural history in a visually dynamic way is intriguing to me.
"I think this student really thought through what they could do with the time and resources with a project, and came up with some really interesting ideas."
"I'm not sure if the first one is something I would work on with this student, just because I like to create things that are used and help people. Although it's a cool idea, I'm not sure that music or sounds playing when you open the door or touch the handle are something that I would find interesting enough to help on. 
 
 
 
 However, I would definitely be able to help with the other two ideas. I think the mapping is a great idea, especially in a very cultural way. You would be able to discover things with the mapping that you wouldn't normally be able to unless you took a trip all the way there which takes time and money. 
 
 
 
 I would also be able to work on the last one, also possibly working on a fun animation PSA to spread across the country and the world and hopefully be able to get more individuals involved in saving the Earth's resources."
"Only two ideas were provided, but I did feel the classmate gave adequate descriptions of their ideas. 
 
 
 
 1.A project that involves touch and sound. When individuals touched a door handle, this action would trigger different sounds. 
 
 2.Large scale projection mapping. The project might involve projecting related historical videos on large historical monuments. The point of this project would be to give tourist the opportunity to learn about history when visiting historical sites.
 
 3.Classmate would like to work on a project that helps people."
The projection mapping project is of the most interest to me. I believe this project would be best accomplished by developing a large scale projector. I like the idea of helping to teach the general public about history in a new and exciting way.
"There is definitely some vague writing on the third idea - saying ""I don't know,"" but maybe doing some game - but the other two ideas - interactive touch sensors to trigger sound, and projection mapping onto landmarks - are less vague, but not all that original. There are plenty of videos on YouTube with people projection mapping onto various buildings, and plenty of things (including childrens' toys) use touch sensors to make noises."
"Were I to work with this student, I would prefer to do something with the projection mapping. Obviously in the classroom/showcase setting we wouldn't be able to project onto anything like the great wall, but we could use the same idea on a smaller scale."
I think that the student made some really good suggestions about creating a arduino program that has some sort of interactive aspect.
"This person gives a pretty clear idea of what he wants to create, but fails to explain the purpose of creating it. What would set it apart? Why make something like this? Sometimes people don't know about a certain movie so how would you then explain your idea to them?
 
 
 
 1. colored light programmed by arduino
 
 2. Virtual Reality gaming
 
 3. Motion Capture rc car"
"I felt that although these explanations were brief, and could have used a bit more detail, the ideas were expressed relatively clearly in such few words. 
 
 
 
 Idea 1: A program that uses an arduino and three buttons. When a button is pushed, an assigned color appears. 
 
 
 
 Idea 2: A program that makes people feel as though they are part of a virtual reality world. The program would involve the whole body, and the user would feel as though they left the real world and were transported into the game. 
 
 
 
 Idea 3: A program that allows a person to drive a car or fly a plane using only hand movements."
"I really liked the idea of a video game that submerged the user into a virtual world. I think perhaps with a pair of virtual reality glasses, some sort of smart gloves and shoes, and perhaps some sort of outfit that had different sensors sewn into the material, this might be possible. This project would however, likely be very involved, and take a great deal of time and resources to accomplish."
I like your idea of building a simple arduino program with a simple sensor system to interact with the user.
"I think the student made an effort with their ideas, although they could use more information as to what tools they would want to try and use. For example, in his third idea, it is unclear as to what softwares or hardware would be needed in order to control the car or plane.
 
 
 
 Reiteration of ideas:
 
 Idea 1 - Using arduino, make an interactive system with 3 buttons that change colors.
 
 Idea 2 - Submerge a user into a virtual reality world.
 
 Idea 3 - Control RC car or plane with hand movements."
I think creating a system to track movement and turn that into to controls of an RC device or like a game or somthing would be fun. This has alread been done using the kinect or WII so a new cool way to do it would need to be devised.
"I had a bit of difficulty understanding the third idea, but overall I felt that Tammy explained her ideas well. 
 
 
 
 1.In a week, Tammy would brainstorm, collect data, create a virtual and a paper prototype, and gather information from users and experts regarding her project. 
 
 2.Tammy would create a therapy program for children with special needs. She would use her resources to hire experts in related fields, and try to create the best program possible. 
 
 3.Tammy would create a mechanism that would record neurological feedback, and heart rate, when a user is exposed to certain stimuli."
"Given the intent of the assignment the student satisfied all the needs and was very thorough throughout the entire assignment. They had very clear purpose in the entire assignment and were very concise.
 
 In the first idea the student stated the steps that they would go through in order to complete a project in a week. In the second idea the student was very clear on what they would do with the money in the answer and what they would use the money for, and to create a machine for special needs children. The last idea was the student wanting to create a project that records brainwaves."
"If me and this student were assigned to work on a project I think that both of us would have to come to a compromise since I am not skilled in the area that the student is speaking of doing a project on. I believe that the second idea that the student spoke on is a project that we could actually work on together, and we could also combine aspects of the first and third idea together to make a really cool project."
"It seems that this student detailed how their proposed project for the semester would look in a week, a semester, and in an unspecific amount of time with a billion dollars, rather than proposing three different ideas. The idea seems to be to make hardware, like a robot, that mimics the way the human body looks and works, with the end goal of using it to study the form of the body. The purpose of studying the form is not clear, though with the types of things this student wishes to do, it appears to be useful for general knowledge of the body for anyone that may want to know, whether artistic or health-related."
I like the Dubai Vacation for brainstorming. I feel that you need to have diversity and variety of locations to brainstorm ideas. If theres ever a trip like that count me in! As far as the mobile mouse case idea goes I think you should finish the product. I saw the pitch and the progress in the previous semester and it is an interesting product.
The only idea that you had was finishing up the mobile mouse case and it seems like your are really focused on getting this prototype finish I would like to collaborate on this product to get this finish if we had to work together.
1. The student said that he/she can finish lots of things in a week. But it depended on the resources. 2. Go to Dubai for brainstorming.3. Mobile mouse case! Sounds cool and I hope you can tell more details about it.
I don't know what mobile mouse case is. It sees like you can use your mobile as a mouse. Very interesting. Hope you can do it!
"It sounds as if you have one solid idea. Could you elaborate a little more on it? You call it your mobile mouse case, so what exactly makes it specialized?"
"I'm pretty sure I couldn't contribute very much. By the sound of it, this student has a pretty good grasp on what they plan on doing. However if they were accepting help I might be able to help craft the project. I spent a year in industrial design crafting prototypes and I might be able to lend a hand in the actual making of this product."
"Some of the ideas were successful, and some weren't. I think their idea 2 was the strongest."
"I really liked the idea 2. We would definitely have to modify it, but I think that within our own phoenix community there are a lot of dichotomies physical appearances."
"Their ideas are far too vague, I can't really start to picture what they had in their mind from this limited explanation. I am not too sure they too this assignment with the utmost sincerity. That being said, the general idea of what they wish to accomplish is quite clear due to its concentration of words. However, many questions about their ideas exist. Why do we need a new internet infrastructure? What type of game/app do you want to develop? What type of installation do you wish to build, and with what tools?
 
 
 
 Their ideas: 
 
 
 
 One Week: A small digital installation that has physical elements to it.
 
 
 
 Unlimited Time and Money: To create a new infrastructure for the internet that allows for everyone to be connected using solar/kinetic power as its power source.
 
 
 
 Realistic Semester: To create an interactive mobile game."
"The student here is perhaps overly succinct, but seems confident that they can create something worthwhile over the course of the semester. I really like the idea of trying to increase and improve internet connectivity in this country. Other industrialized countries have bandwidth and speed that put us to shame. Replacing all of the old copper lines with fiber would be awesome!"
"If the student goes with creating a game I'd love to do character and concept sketches, storyboards and other visual aspects."
The app is a great idea because as far I know there are none out there for motorcyclist enthusiasts. For the project you could even combine the idea of graphics for motorcycles and use the app to share cool projects that people may be working on or want to collaborate on.
I really do believe that this student made a sincere effort with this assignment and thinking about what they really want to do in these situations. I think that they really dug deep in thinking what they would want to do based off of what they love to do with their hobbies.
I believe the student put in a lot of effort but I only seem to see two distinct ideas.
My DC concentration is insound so I would be very interested in finding a way to incorporate his sound project.
"I think that you have some good ideas. I really liked the first idea that you came up with it sounds as if you have put some thought into it. As for your second idea, would it be possible to empower these communities with a simplified version of your plan. When I think of the struggles that these communities have to deal with, my first notion is not that they are in need of jobs. Couldn't you help provide these communities with the means of acquiring power without setting up a full on power plant? Is there a cheaper, more dispensable means of creating a power generating device for these communities? Much like the paper water filter book, could you develop something that could provide usable energy at a low cost?"
"I like your enthusiasm, and I would definitely work on a project with you if you brought this kind of attitude into a group project. I too would choose to work on a project that could extend beyond the classroom into helping the outside world with what I have learned within the DC program. Last year I worked on developing a garden that took care of itself with the help of an arduino. However this proved to be a really difficult project for only one person to work on, and was never completed to it's full potential. Therefore if you happen to stumble across an idea that your really feel passionate about, I would be on board to help make it happen."
"The student actually made a sincere effort and I believe gave very honest answers, except for the third answer, the student didn't really answer the question or give an idea. The student actually clearly proposes two things, the first idea was about making an inspirational film, the second idea was about researching what makes a human happy without drugs, and to make a device that trains the human brain to think in a positive and non negative way."
"I believe that with the first idea is definitely something that both me and the student could work on. I love films and I love working on films, I think that could definitely be a fun project to work on with someone else, I also believe we could combine elements of the second idea in order to make an inspirational film about how people can be happy and train themselves to think in more positive ways."
"I like the idea about making people happy and I know there is someone else who would like to do something similar to that in this class. What I think I would do first with this idea is to set a specific group (like college students around campus) and just go out and start interviewing. If you have a set list of questions its easy to just go up to someone and ask for some input. The good thing about starting on campus is that there are so many students from all different backgrounds, you'll start to get that wide variety of research you're looking for."
"In the first idea, they clearly propose they would make a short film that was inspirational and intriguing to an audience. The only thing about this is, different people feel different emotions. What is intriguing to one person could bore the living hell out of another.
 
 
 
 The second idea is basically saying they want to make people happy! Without the use of any drugs. I fully support this idea.
 
 
 
 There isn't really a third idea, just the student saying that they want to work more with the development side of things."
"I really would love to go off of the whole making people happy thing, but again, emotions are very subjective. Unless we actually had something that is proven to effectively make different people happy each time they use this product, it wouldn't work well. I mean, we could take a survey of everyone in DC and ask them what they think is funny, or what makes them happy, and you can make a short film on it?"
"Idea 1: a short film discussing a topic of interest.
 
 Idea 2: Work to organize and fund the creation of something that could provide clean water to people, or use a similar process for a different issue.
 
 Idea 3: Make music. 
 
 
 
 Though the specifics are a little vague, this student has proposed three ideas and has touched on the details and motivations for them."
"My ideas involve 3D animation, and this student's ideas involve filmmaking, humanitarian organization, and music making.
 
 
 
 So a joint project might could take many forms. Humanitarian concerns can be (and are commonly) addressed in both film and music, and animation can go with both. Maybe it is an animated short film (or at least partially animated), or maybe it is an animated music video to a song or series of songs."
"The student said they could make some sort of interactive installation, something robotic, or a matrix made of LEDs for the first idea. For the second idea, the student said that instead of one huge project, they would would work on making what we have easier to make and at cheaper costs. This way, more people could make things to solve more problems. For the third idea, I kind of don't understand it, but that's totally on me because it seems like they know what they are talking about. I'm just not sure the final outcome."
Together we could create some kind of interaction between a physical and digital system.
"The person has a broad range of interests, but I feel that the first two responses are really vague since they talk about what kind of projects they want to work on rather than what projects. Also, what they specified in the first question may be something that would be more than they can handle in one week.
 
 
 
 The third idea is much clearer as they explain their project and its structure and functions. 
 
 
 
 Their three ideas are some project that deals with electrical devices, a cheap hardware to help people, and a mechanical display that moves in fluid-like motion."
"Yes, I think they though deeply about what they could and would do."
There is great expanse on ideas and passions in this idea run. The first idea is to use MAX/MSP to create a sound to light interactive system. The second idea is to create a theatre company that can reproduce the quality of theater performances here in america in countries without significant funding for musicals and theatre performances. The third idea is to create new content for a musical play.
I have created musical compositions for musicals in the past and I would love to be a part of a team to create new content for musicals. It would also be a privilege to find a way to create a good quality theatre performances in other countries.
"I found this classmates ideas interesting, but had difficulty understanding the details, and how their ideas would be accomplished. 
 
 
 
 1. In a week, this classmate would brainstorm and ask key questions about their project. They are most interested in working on a project that connects sound and visuals. 
 
 2. This classmate would like to create an infinite theatre, with an interactive component. The theatre would involve state of the art equipment and take up an unlimited amount of space. 
 
 3. In a semester, this classmate would create an interactive performance scene."
"If I were to work with this classmate I would be most interested in working with him to create an infinite theatre. This idea sounded interesting, but I couldnt quite understand the details or picture the end result. I think this project would involve a great deal of technological and artistic components, but I would need to have a better understanding of the project to know what was needed to physically accomplish it."
I can see where this student was heading. So there ideas were thoughtful but just not expressed deeply through the assignment but it is obvious they have passion for this project.
Well they appear to be interested in graphics and rich story line. We could certainly make a roleplaying game out of their novel.
"I think he/she seem like a visual artist, especially 3d animator or interactive media. I can imagine this interactive media system relate with human body. I think 3D animation project is so many potential energy in diverse field like he/she is interested in human psychology."
"I can imagine how his/her project would be great if these three ideas will be developed. To make a go of it, I think he/she has to collaborate with kind of artists such as media installation, sound, or performers. These project ideas are impressive for me and it would be very helpful to make human life better if you develop his/her own system in this semester."
"We could develop some sort of animation together, as I had done a lot of animation work myself."
The student gave an honest and sincere effort and I believe gave some great answers. The student clearly proposes three ideas in their post. The first idea that the student proposes is essentially making a virtual character (which I think is really cool). The second idea was also a digital animation idea on making a very detailed video game. The last idea was about creating a digitally constructed visual.
If me and this student were assigned to collaborate for the semester I think we could make some very cool digital visuals because this student seems to be very experienced in making digital visuals and I am very artistic and creative and I think I could help this student with some great ideas for visuals that he could actually make on the computer.
There are three ideas proposed with significant information for me to understand the ideas. The first idea is to create a website or game. The second idea is to create a virtual world with content that mirrors this world. I love the idea of replicating an reliving historical time periods. The third idea is to create a game with intelligent AI that can replicate a human player.
I would collaborate with this student to create real stimulating sound for the virtual world idea. One of the most important parts of our experience and reality is the 5 senses. I would want to make sure the sound design is perfectly matched to how it is in reality.
"I think that this student and I could work very well together. My background is in computers and computer programming as well, I think we could take the smaller idea as is and make it into a full blown project."
"This student made a very sincere effort and gave some very interesting answers, the student clearly proposed three ideas. The first idea is about showcasing project mapping by using max msp. The second idea is an interactive gaming system for children in hospitals that involves a digital environment. The last idea was creating a new way of playing video games that eliminates ""screen watching""."
"It is very apparent that this person to the time and effort to sincerely answer all three idea questions. They go into detail on what they exactly want to accomplish as well as what tools they would like to use for their project. I could very easily get a picture in my head for each of their three concepts and thus believe they explained their points clearly and concisely.
 
 
 
 Their ideas: 
 
 
 
 One Week: They wish to using projection mapping for either an art gallery or to show off their own line of clothing. They would use Max msp to facilitate the projection mapping and would plan on using video.
 
 
 
 Unlimited Time and Money: The wish to create a digital environment projection mapped into a room that children in hospitals and explore and play with using their hands or feet instead of controllers.
 
 
 
 Realistic Semester: A cube that would not allow the transgression of video game screen looking to cheat when planing with friends. This cube will have each player's perspective projection mapped on a different face making nigh impossible to catch a glimpse of what your friend in doing."
"I think your anti screen looking project idea is amazing, too often I have caught my younger brother committing this cardinal video game sin. The cube was a great idea, ignoring the top and bottom of the cube you have 4 surfaces and with video games often offering 4 player co-op you can projection map on each of the sides. you can make the cube sort of a furniture piece, coming with chairs (maybe cubes as well), and a way to easily store it+its projectors. I can not help you on the lines of knowing Max, but I think you should think ahead a bit to on how you could market such an awesome device/piece of furniture. The cube look could work as a ""futuristic"" vibe and that alone could be enough to get people interested. You could also make it so that it could be installed in arcades or bars allowing people to play games with friends or strangers."
"This person has a major interest in projection mapping and interactive environments, this could be relatively easy to work with the appropriate direction and resource management. Even if there is an inclusion of a clothing brand, the proposals are concise and clear."
"My way-far-out-you-are-insane addition: let's make a completely projected room from the outside-in, possibly using something like four white cloth sheets and project a 3D space from outside and possibly add some sort of motion tracking mechanism with objects or the people.
 
 
 
 My bound-to-earth proposal: yeah, let's do that."
"You have a good grasp on what you'd like to do. As long as you're comfortable with projection mapping I believe that all of your ideas will work. I'm not exactly sure what you would do with the art gallery, but if you've made some pieces of you're own you could make them pop using the projection. I also like that you're thinking of working with kids. You can do a lot with the idea of making an interactive environment around them, and even make it so that they can visit different places around the world from their own bed. The only thing I'm concerned about with the xbox is the split screen projection mapping. You might have to work with 2 different projectors."
I'd want to work more with your clothing brand idea. If you have some physical objects that people could model you could take video of that and then build a runway like stage to make an infinite runway. Along it you could use projection mapping on some mannequins along the way so that people can look at what you have.
"I do not think that I could help out with project 1 in much of a way as I do not have any carving experience, but possibly I could assist in the formation of ideas 2 or 3. The ideation seems pretty confident with project three so I think I could only assist in the actual physical construction of the installation, it doesn't seem like there would be much software involved. In idea 3 I could possibly help in the ideation process and define a solid idea of what the implemented project actually will be."
"This is the most well thought out and fully realized pitches for an idea I've read so far. The carving of a wolf sounds like a lot of fun, but also a lot of work. The space installation sounds fascinating, especially the concepts being conveyed by the piece."
I honestly don't know what I'd have to offer this student as far as her project goes. She seems to have her concepts and procedures and work steps pretty thoroughly planned out and there's not much of a visually element that would make my drawing skills necessary.
They made a sincere effort and proposed three ideas. The first idea was to carve a hyper realistic figure of a wolf. The second was to create some sort of environment that creates something eco-friendly. The third was to create a frame to a viewer could see the light in some creative way.
The idea about creating the frame sounds very unique. I would like to see something like that.
"The person has definitely thought about it, and although the second idea doesn't have an exact project, the idea is there. 
 
 The first idea is to make a sculpture. 
 
 The second idea is to somehow create a way to emotionally connect with other people using technology of some sort. 
 
 The third idea is to create an installation that in short, involves a light and it delivers a message about personal serenity."
"Time travel has always been an interest of mine. That being said, and Alternate Timeline Transportation Device sounds pretty cool. Paradoxes are no fun, so this seems like a much more safe alternative."
"This person shows really fun ideas that may or may not be simple but are interesting to see. The ideas are quite clear with specific features. 
 
 
 
 Their three ideas are simultaneous video game plays, virtual reality device that allows changes in the user's past, and an interactive display with a projection mapping of a mermaid."
"The interactive system featuring the mermaid and the inverse of Twitch Plays Pokemon seem like two appealing ideas that can be blended. I am thinking that the project could be an installation of tv and projector such that a video game console is hooked up to a tv, which has a projection mapping of a mermaid on the screen. Whatever button a user presses on their console, the button can affect the mermaid's behaviors."
"All three responses are good ideas, even if idea #2 is currently technologically infeasible. 
 
 
 
 1. A setup that allows a player to play 5 simple games at once as an interesting experience. 
 
 
 
 2. A device that allows users to jump between timelines/ dimensions to try out different actions or choices in life. 
 
 
 
 3. A tank with a projection mapped mermaid inside that reacted to people in a room."
"I think that the mermaid tank idea is really interesting, though it would likely be rather difficult. Making a prototype of this however could be feasible in a semester or two, where a smaller or simpler object or the skeleton of the mermaid model could be mapped into a special fish tank."
"The ideas are definitely clear as they are and feel well thought-out. The first idea is a stand to hold various electronic devices and chargers on a stand, specifically next to a bed. The second idea is a low-cost wearable device that generates energy through being outdoors or exercising, potentially solving both energy and health problems through motivating people to exercise to charge their electronic devices. The third idea is a game in which the student does most of the artistic work (art, models, environments, etc), and although the exact design of the game is not clear, it appears the student would prefer to work on a shooter of some sort."
"I like the idea of a hat or shirt that gathers electricity and i would want to branch off more on that, more because I'm not really sure about you're game idea, but I'd also like to learn more about it. As for the clothing, I think a big thing is focusing on the overall design of the clothing, to make sure that people would wear them. I also think development of a solar battery would need to go into the shits/hats/pants as well. Things to consider is if they need to be connected to the shirt at all times, how heavy they would be, and if the article are machine washable."
"The student made a very good effort on his/her thoughts. All three ideas were detailed and gave the reader a good ideas as to what the student would want accomplished, and possible tools that would be used in order to accomplish their goals.
 
 
 
 Reiteration of ideas:
 
 Idea 1 - Creating a model of a stand to hold all of his electronic devices and chargers by his bed to watch from.
 
 
 
 Idea 2 - Creating wearable technology that is attached to the clothing that gathers solar, body heat, and kinetic energy, as a source of energy that could be stored into a battery.
 
 
 
 Idea 3 - Creating a virtual reality game for the oculus rift, likely a first person shooter, that also uses a suit, fans, and other devices to simulate a more realistic experience."
I think part of his third idea would likely be a good choice for a semester/year long project. A group of people would definitely be able to create a virtual world using Unity to create a simple first person shooter. This project could possibly be taken even further depending on the time and try to incorporate the coding needed to make this game usable with the Oculus Rift.
"The student could use more time to get more specific with the ideas.
 
 The first just states what they would work with not exactly what they would make.
 
 The second is for a system that automatically tended to a garden, I was wondering how this would be done.
 
 The last is for an interactive sculpture which seems interesting."
"I really like the arduino planting idea. I'm not really sure what I add at this point, but the idea is interesting and could really find a use in different businesses around the world."
"The student put in a lot of time and effort into his/her ideas. Although these ideas are very detailed with what the student wants accomplished in the end, ideas 2 and 3 need more information as to what exactly Digital Culture students would be doing during the semester/year to apply their skills, aka, the ""engage and make it fun"" and ""find a way to expand"" needs work. I do understand the overall goal but this needs more explanation as to what a group of 4 students would be doing exactly.
 
 
 
 Reiteration of ideas:
 
 Idea 1 - Complete composition of two songs for cinematic, game, or advertisement.
 
 Idea 2 - Create campus ministries in all of the universities in America to establish relationships with the campus and business in the respective state.
 
 Idea 3 - Build partnerships with organizations and expand The Respect Movement to other campuses."
"Since your first idea seems to show an interest in creating music, I think you could tie this in with ideas 2 and 3. As an example, use the semester to create a song, maybe even a music video, to promote ideas 2 and 3. This music video could use projectors, cameras, and software that the digital culture has available to students."
"Your idea is very deeply thought out. Religion is an important aspect in an individual's life and it can help one out through college experience. I know the feeling of being wanting to fit into a group or service that you are interested and passion about. Your project seems very interesting, not everyone will agree to religion but they will agree to a community build upon passion"
I would be interested in seeing how far this project would go. I want to see the process of this project campaign and how it is develop. The ministry service is an project that look like it would grow by time not so sure about how big but I would like to contribute someway to see that project grows.
This person made a sincere effort to express their ideas. This persons ideas were about creating clubs and organizations to help teach respect and other important things to our ASU students. These are some awesome ideas but I would try and leave religion out of it.
"The person has definitely thought of what they wanted to do. Although, I'm honestly not sure how exactly it would tie into digital culture. I do see potential in it though. Maybe some more thought about what digital culture is about, then try and make something that ties directly to that idea.
 
 The first idea is to basically make a song for someone.
 
 The second idea is to create an organization kinda like the Newman Center but better.
 
 The third idea is to become more connected with other campuses to create a more equal culture."
"Not sure if the second idea is really for the billion dollars if not simply use $100 and get away with $999'999,900 at hand, but hey, honestly I would like some of that cheddar too. But I digress:
 
 
 
 This person has obvious interests in using projection mapping as a central thematic and makes absolute sense. Except, again, for the eyebrow-raising budget of a billion dollars for a simple project like that."
"I am intrigued by the project on the third bullet, only thing that keeps me wondering how well it would work is just the movement part because part of the illusion of space involvements like this is kinesthesic activity.
 
 
 
 SO!
 
 
 
 Introducing Virtuix Omni: a treadmill specifically designed of VR movement. http://www.virtuix.com/
 
 
 
 Perhaps using this could help with the production, albeit I am not sure if it would work way much better using Oculus Rift as well, which might just ruin the point of creating a projected environment outside.
 
 
 
 But I digress, I can sense something brewing."
"The ideas of a physical object that can be projected on with animations that can cater to the shape, a cloth or outfit that can be tracked and projected onto for plays and musicals, and a Immersive animation sequence that give the persona sense of being in the POV of the character. You did give this sincere effort and I do like the three of your ideas. I actually love the idea of the clothing that can be tracked and projected onto. It sounds extremely difficult but since your given a billion dollars I'm sure you can accomplish it."
"I would like to go with the immersive environment animation because it coordinates well with my idea of make an immersive environment for sick children in a Child's Hospital. I feel if we made an animation sequence that can give the children a sense of POV of the character on their journey, that could greatly be helpful for them. Since most of the children do not have access to such adventures, we could make an immersive environment that can give them a sense of adventure. Also incorporate the clothing onto the child so say the child is a knight on a quest, the immersive environment would be projected onto the surrounded and a knight's outfit or armor can be projected onto the clothing of the child to really give them the POV of the character."
"These projects seem to be well thought out considering the constraints.
 
 The first is for a simple projection mapping on an object.
 
 The second is for a wearable system that communicates with projector some how to trigger different displays.
 
 The last is for a animation that gives the viewer two different perspectives, I think this would be interesting but might be complicated."
"The student I believe did give a sincere and to the point answer with their ideas, the student also clearly proposed three things. The first idea that the student spoke of was mapping animations on to objects and using the object's shape as a way of increasing the visual effects of the animations. The second idea was mapping and tracking clothing on individuals and using it for artistic purposes. The last idea was creating a projection that allows the user to step inside the object being projected on and view the shots from the characters point of view."
With these three ideas I believe that me and this student could work on some cool mapping project that uses the artistic aspects the student spoke of in the third idea to make a really cool visual experience for the viewers.
"I honestly don't feel like I know enough about the type of thing being proposed, so I have no idea how I would contribute. Although I do think 2 & 3 are worthy of the time and effort."
The ideas are great. The steps of making a one-week project are organized. But they are too general so I can't develop more ideas base on that.
"The student put in effort into their ideas but I think more details are needed, as well as possible tools/skills that would be required. In idea 2, I love the idea, but how would you incorporate the solar energy part with this clean water process? In idea 3, I think more information is needed as to what materials/tools/skills would possibly be required for a group of students to create possible prototypes.
 
 
 
 Reiteration of ideas:
 
 Idea 1 - Creation of the outline, draft, visual presentation, write up, and materials required for a possible project.
 
 Idea 2 - Provide clean water to people, and also an air transport system to collect rain water, purify it, and then distribute it, by using solar energy.
 
 Idea 3 - Create prototypes of idea 2 and distribute it with biodegradable containers."
I very much enjoy the idea of the rain water collecting building. We take for granted of the water supply we get in America even though some part of the country is hurting from trouts and lack of water. For an idea that gather rain water for usage is a pretty good idea. The facility can be build in an area that is rich with rain during certain time of the year like Florida or Washington. If you can collect the water then filter and a way to distribute it it would be really helpful.
I would definitely partner up on this project since it is about a subject that is very important in life and for society to have clean running water is very important.
Yes this student made a sincere effort to explain their ideas. One of their projects was about scanning magic cards and projecting some type of holographic image. The other was to make a portfolio of all the work they have completed and also a short animation film.
"This student has some great ideas, especially the studio idea. I would use my skills in web-development and programming to help out in any way I could to get a studio going."
"I really like the Magic idea, at the moment the streams of Magic Invitationals are rather boring but adding in the spectacle of the 3D rendering could really ramp up the entertainment."
"Three things were pretty clearly proposed. The stop-motion idea is intriguing, as is the holograph-magic card idea (even if it's a little derivative of the yugi-oh anime). And the portfolio development sounds like a really awesome idea."
"I'd love to collaborate on any of these projects, Doing concept sketches of possible characters for the magic cards, or helping to sculpt creatures for the stop-motion animation sound awesome. spending a semester working with other artists and collaborating on creating our individual portfolios and having that input from other artists sounds so beneficial."
This person made a sincere effort and proposed three ideas. The first was to create a stop motion film. The second was to create an interface that scans and 3D prints magic cards. The third was to generate a personal portfolio.
"I like the idea of creating an interface that would create 3D prints of magic cards. Ever since I was little when I use to collect pokemon cards and yugioh cards, I always thought it would be amazing if they had something that I could scan my cards with and that would put them into a game or something. To this day they don't really have anything like that as far as for card games. I know they have Skylanders which sort of does the same thing but for action figures."
"This entry suggests a website that builds on the great commercial success of JK Rowling's series of books and movies. 
 
 The interaction by the reader with the capability of creating their pathway is enticing for people."
"This entry is direct and to the point meeting the need of immediate satisfaction that this world now craves.
 
 It meets the challenge by explaining the site in a clear fashion without emotion yet allows the excitement of the fan world to glimpse through the basic unemotional descriptions."
"Interesting choice of future book. The strengths of your entry are in the wide variety of uses for blogs as well as examples for them. You have done a lot of research, and it shows. 
 
 The blog meets the challenge of future book by being a never ending, ever-evolving work of text contributed to by many."
Wow! Those are quite the concepts for reading in the future. You have listed a variety and their uses today and in the time to come.
There is a lot of information there. Reddit appears to be an ever expanding source of information. If this is so then it meets the challenge like the blog.
"Anything Star Wars is an automatic win in my book, and I'm all for retro feels. The physical description of the book and its contents is clear, and taking the reader through the steps of how the images change is helpful to understand what makes this book special."
Fantastic description of the capabilities and (likely endless) possibilities of tumblr. Thorough representation of how you feel tumblr is changing the face of books/lit related media and the features available to bloggers.
"Excellent description of the features, functionality, and purpose of Pottermore website. I had heard of it before, but always considered it to be a stagnant wiki for the Potter 'verse. It was enlightening to know that Rowling continues to participate. I think your description of how this is part of the future of books was laid out well using this specific example."
"Excellent fact backup and mini-history of audio-blogging/podcasting. Section 3 is well thought out and highlights the pitfalls of a physical printing process, while underscoring the viability of podcasts as a literary medium. Bonus points for the use of ""bourgeois""."
Completed assignment on time.
"What a great example! I had no idea what to write about in my description and think that you chose the perfect media. You've provided a ton of information in your 300 word allotted space. There definitely isn't much ""fluff""- you get down to business from the start. I wish I had a better grasp of what this technology is, as I then think that this would be an extremely informative explanation. Your knowledgable of this type of media is apparent in your description and I learned something new by reading your assignment. 
 
 
 
 You seem confident in your prediction of the future of the book and readers of your assignment cannot deny the contagiousness of your excitement."
"Your summary is great - straightforward and provides the necessary information to understand your idea of the future of books. You chose a very interesting subject matter and I'm excited to check out www.postsecret.com in my free time.
 
 
 
 Your 300 word description is extremely clear and easy to follow. The time that you spent working on this assignment is apparent. You gave a great description of the book itself and allowed your readers to have a grasp of your personal experience with the book and how it changed the way you 
 
 
 
 My favorite line of your description is the following: ""The book is colorful and dark, emotional and boring, fantastic and dull.""
 
 
 
 I love the following line as well: ""What makes this book afuture book is that it doesnt have a single author. It is more like an interactive blog or news feed on an internet social media sight than an actual book."" I wouldn't have linked this book with the ever-popular social media world, but your point is great and so true.
 
 
 
 Overall, I don't think that your assignment needs much revising. You did a great job with the rough draft and looks more like a final draft to me than a rough draft!
 
 
 
 I look forward to reading and critiquing your future assignments for this course!"
"The only thing I can say could use a bit of revising would be that you kept repeating that this book is a compilation of many different people's thoughts. I felt while reading your assignment that you may have repeated this so many times in different ways to fill space and hit the required word counts. If this is true, it's unfortunate because you did a great job on this assignment. I'd omit some of these repetitive phrases in your final draft.
 
 
 
 I also noticed the misspelling of a word in the following sentence: ""What makes this book afuture book is that it doesnt have a single author. It is more like an interactive blog or news feed on an internet social media sight ([SITE]<--change to this spelling) that an actual book."""
"You gave a great summary of the work that you chose to be the future of books. Your quick snippet of a description is clear and purposeful. Your readers have a great grasp on what they are about to read in your description.
 
 
 
 I love that you included a link in your description and have every intention on visiting the website in my free time to learn more about ""Click-Clack the Rattlebag"".
 
 
 
 My favorite sentences of your assignment were the following:'Click-Clack the Rattlebag is a book in name only. Its text is entirely invisible, you see: invisible like ghosts. And thus, aesthetically,Click-Clack is a work of art presented entirely in vocal narrative."" As a reader, you definitely got me interested in the media that you chose to explore and the eerie ""Click-Clack the Rattlebag""."
"I disagree with you that the future of books will be audiobooks! That's besides the point though and a personal opinion, not a literary critique. In all, I think that you completed this assignment in a purposeful, meaningful manner.
 
 
 
 Perhaps the only critique I have is that maybe you could explain why audiobooks haven't already taken off (it's a media that's been around for quite some time) and expand on the idea of why now is the audiobook's perfect opportunity for a comeback."
"Wow! I absolutely love that you included a picture with your summary. It made your assignment come alive and was obviously the first thing that I noticed when I clicked on the title of your work. Not only did you include a picture, but it's a very interesting picture! Just by reading your summary, I got super curious as to what experiencing ""touch"" would be like on pottermore.com. I didn't know such a website existed about the Harry Potter series but am not surprised! I only read a couple of the Harry Potter books (I've never been much into fiction) but am curious and excited to explore the website. It's great that you included the link within your writing.
 
 
 
 Your excitement of this media is apparent in your writing, and definitely string along your readers to read through your whole assignment. I love how you mentioned that the pottermore.com crashed during it's initial release, that you insist that this website is just ""that cool.""
 
 
 
 I love that you realized the following: ""While it is not a replacement for the tome-like books, it brings a flair that is impossible to experience with paper alone."" (My assignment is based on this idea as well.)
 
 
 
 I think my favorite line of your assignment was the following: ""If this website could be neatly bound, pressed, and fitted with a dust jacket, it might be the most perfect book of the future."" You realize that even though the website is super cool, there is still a need for tangible bound books. I agree!"
"UNFORTUNATELY, I don't think that your assignment needs much revision. You did an excellent job of ""doing it right the first time"" and it is obvious that your sentences are thoughtful and calculated.
 
 
 
 If anything, maybe include the pottermore.com link in your summary?
 
 
 
 Great work. I'm looking forward to reading and ""critiquing"" your future assignments for this class!"
"The entry specifically points to the book's uniqueness, in that it is not necessarily just an e-book or a website; it is her brand. This meets the assignment's challenge by being both specific and creative by finding a book that is very atypical."
"The future factor explanation is very well done. I definitely want to find something like this, as I'm sure most people who enjoy faster processing would. By appealing to the demand of the people, this entry meets the challenge, though it does not offer a way for people to actually find such a book."
"This is highly imaginative and definitely something that would be a fun, interactive experience for any reader. It meets the challenge by turning a book into a video game, something that is surely being worked on by the creators of e-books and web-books."
"Using a PostSecret book is a great choice. It is compiled of thousands of people's work, making it a unique, collaborative project (that, somehow, still keeps its secrets). The explanation of the future factor is spot on: it is a blog in a book, and surely a medium that will evolve into something great."
"Perhaps in the future factor section, the author could make a solid case for why exactly I should go out and buy it. While obviously I'm interested, what specifically makes this book extra appealing, and why?"
"The book promoted truly does break down barriers of storytelling, as the author states. It is a wonderful example of the future book, and giving many examples of its strengths makes the entry very convincing. Additionally, the author's telling is both engaging and compelling."
"I really like how you pointed out, in the beginning of your explanation, that you do not think books will ever die. I think this is important because, it keeps in mind that yes, although documentary film is becoming an extremely popular way for information to be transferred, it is not going to replace the traditional method of exchanging information. It also allows for books to remain special and sacred, and to stay an outlet for those who want to ˜disappear into their own world. This being said, you make an excellent point in stating that film is very relatable as it is easy to SEE another individual, and thus experience aspects of their lives with them. I also think you did a very good job explaining the film and in explaining the intrigue and the value in its genre as a documentary."
"The only thing I think may have been too bold of a statement was when you said that ""film will always be more powerful than text"". I do think that this is a rather subjective statement, as many individuals absolutely become enchanted by and involved in a story when it is on page, because so much is left up to their own imagination. The voice and image of a character, the tone or the character's overall mood, the atmosphere of a building or of a place - and the beauty of written text, at least in fictional stories, is that my perception of a character will never match another's; yet, in a film, a character appears in a very straightforward way, with very little interpretation to the viewer. I think it very much depends on the genre, for one to say that film is more powerful than text. Of course, if a demonstration or learning technique needs to be taught, I can definitely see how film is the way to go. But as for me, I have always been more comfortable with text, as it is easy for me to segment, control, and become enveloped in a story. I guess my critique would be to clarify WHEN film is more powerful than text (as you did) instead of making a general statement that film is ALWAYS better, as many people may not feel this is true. But, other then this, I literally thought that what you wrote was perfect, and I think you posed wonderful points and thoughts - great job!"
"I agree with you that sites such as tumblr are growing to be exponentially popular. In addition to liking and reblogging photos, users can reblog and critique or praise an individual's work, which includes but is not limited to: art,photography, music, poetry, and short stories. Because there is potential for re-blogging content, if an individual posts exceptional work, their work is likely to become extremely popular on the site, which can be a very good thing for the original poster. I think that many people who use tumblr use the site for the exact purpose of discovering and connecting to other people's posts, opinions, and self-created work."
"The problem I see with tumblr is that there is no citation, and it is very easy to 'steal' one's work. In the tumblr guidelines, it explicitly states that all content you post is liable to be viewed and re-used by other people. This means someone can re-blog a story or poem you write, and totally trash it, or even edit it themselves. While this is wrong and most individuals wouldn't do this, there is nothing in the tumblr guidelines stating that this is wrong, and tumblr staff cannot be held responsible for if an OP is not given credit for a 'stolen' picture or post. In the future, do you think that there could be an add-on to tumblr that instates a rule or a policy that enables an original poster to always receive credit for their work? If books are moving to be completely online, would not this be necessary on a site like tumblr, if an author wanted to maintain their credibility and their autonomy as the original writer of a work?
 
 Also, another problem I see is that, while there is SO MUCH creativity possible on tumblr, there is not really a place for those who want to become involved in a story to go. If I wanted to read an entire, thousand page book, or even a book series, I would not go on tumblr to do it. It just isn't possible to read so much information on a post. In addition, an author cannot make any profit, or gain any credit other than recognition from writing a book - so if tumblr were to be the future of books, there would be no way for a writer to make a living. Do you think that, in the future, it would be again possible to add on to the site a place for writers of long novels / book series? In this add-on, could it be included that one would have to purchase the author's work before being able to view it and reblog it? This way they are still following the 'tumblr way' and re-blogging work, but they are also honoring an author's time and energy, and cannot simply view it / re-blog without giving at least some form of tribute. This would also make it a lot less possible for someone to 'edit' or 'remove' the OP's part in the post, and it would also still allow for a re-blogger to leave commentary - just, the work wouldn't be free, as books are not free. 
 
 Just a thought! I think the idea of tumblr being the future of books is genius!"
"I think you did an excellent job of building up this book. You made the book seem very intriguing, exciting, and above all, futuristic. I have no idea how you managed to include pictures, but the pictures certainly did an amazing job of enhancing the work and proving your overall point. Through viewing the photos alone, and without reading any of your text, I got the feel that this book is incredibly different than other 'traditional' books, and in this I think you absolutely met the challenge of this assignment. I think that, in your final draft, your photos will do an outstanding job at proving your point. In addition to this, your writing was well-thought out, properly organized, and succeeded in dynamically building up the book you chose. Great work!"
"I honestly do not believe you need to embellish upon your original draft before it is finalized; your work was clear, concise, and to the point, as well as implanting an interest and an intrigue in not only the work you described, but also in a genre of books that follows the style of your chosen work. I wouldn't change anything to this draft, so good job!"
"I do agree that websites such as Reddit are not only very popular now, but will also continue to be popular in the future. People want a way to interact with one another, and also want to find individuals who share certain interests. As you said, it is not just text that is used on Reddit, but also pictures. In addition, people can also bring in other information to help others out or to just share interesting experiences, and I think that people of todays generations and in future generations really enjoy that autonomy in writing and reading."
"The only issue I see with your future book idea is that, unless actual books / stories are uploaded by Reddit users, one cant really become involved / pulled in to a fictional world or fantasy land. For many, books are a means of escape, and many book readers want to become involved in the lives of the characters, want to understand them and relate to them, fight for them or fight against them; also, many individuals who read also like the idea of an alternate world existing. For instance, I believe that this is why so many series, like Harry Potter, The Hunger Games, or The Lord of the Rings, were so huge  because there was another universe that readers could disappear into. 
 
 Im not saying that there is no possibility for things like this to exist on Reddit  but your post didnt really give the feeling that users post stories full of characters or alternate worlds. I think that, if you were to include that in the future, entire books and stories will be uploaded onto Reddit, that this is the way books may be read in the future. For instance, if you said something akin to the following,instead of authors publishing books through a publishing company, maybe they will publish their novels through websites such as Reddit, as so many individuals use this website, it would give the sense that books in general are moving in the direction of being completely online through such websites."
"I believe that this description of the Role-Playing book was sufficient in answering the prompt questions. In addition, the OP made the Role Playing book seem exciting, challenging, and subjective to one's decisions and preferences, which many individuals will most certainly enjoy. The book is also not limited, it seems, to a physical, hand-held book, and can also be read and 'played' on e-devices, making it accessible from many different locations and in many different ways. The reader will be in control of the outcome of the ending, which can be a delightful experience for many individuals who prefer this type of book."
"I believe that the author should make sure to be more clear about the fact that you can use this book in more ways than just reading through pages. Although e-devices were mentioned, I was still confused as to whether or not this type of book would be hand-held, on an e-device, or both. How will the book be accessed on an e-device - from a website? Will it be purchased and downloaded instantaneously, or ordered? Will it have any software that must be installed onto an e-device? While the author said that this book would be available for e-devices, I feel it should be more explicitly stated that it can fluctuate between being an experience through page or through screen, both, or neither, because I am still unsure as to whether this book can be read in the way a traditional book is read, or if that is not the case at all. Other than this, this genre of future books sounds exciting!"
"The article is well-written and accurately describes the subject matter and how it can be seen in the future of the book, particularly in the realm of fan-author interactions."
"For the most part, the article is solid, even if the ""Description"" section is a bit short.
 
 
 
 My only criticism is that the article seems to only give vague examples as the girth of interactive activities that are available on Pottermore. For example, fan fiction--it's described as a hub for it, what does Pottermore offer that other fanfiction hosting websites do not? How is fanfiction integrated with other areas of the website mentioned, if there is any at all? 
 
 
 
 Also, because Pottermore is an online entity, perhaps it would be helpful to include links?"
"The links are very helpful for anyone who isn't immediately familiar with the app, and the Future Factor of the material is stated very clearly."
"While the links are certainly very helpful, the ""Description"" segment of the article seems to rely on them too much instead of making its own unique statement about what the app is and why the audience should be interested."
"The article is very well written and gives the reader a good understanding of the nature of the Pottermore website. Adding the detail about the site crashing on launch is also a great way to show that it's not just the author who feels positive about this sort of continuation of printed works in the digital realm, as is comparing it to other popular social media."
"The author does an excellent job of both describing the material, making it sound almost irresistible to readers, and explaining why this book exemplifies how technology will shape the future of the book. Providing the link to the material in question is also quite nice."
"The article is very well-rounded and addresses many valid points about blogs and how they reflect the changing nature of writing online, publishing online, and the closer interactions between reader and writer."
"""Annarasumanara"" is a Korean variation on the many Japanese web-based, comic-book style stories that grew out of the Manga and Anime and comics of a few decades ago and that have now become rendered as graphically enhanced software that can be displayed on computer screens. The strength of this entry is that it does demonstrate an important aspect of the continuing evolution of books by showing us an example of one segment of the ""reading pool"" that is now making the transition from print to digital format."
"This is a reasonable example of the direction in which future books are heading, but as the author continues to develop the field guide, it may be interesting for the reader if some of the history of the comic book, particularly as it developed in Japan (Manga, Anime) and Korea (Manhwa) is provided, as well as some thoughts on where all of this may be going as we proceed through this century and beyond. For example, it would seem that this style of reading entertainment -- especially popular to young adults -- is well suited for eventual transformation into 3-D renderings, perhaps even holographic, at some point in the future. In addition, some reference and relevance to our course readings (if possible) would make for a stronger case in point."
"This is quite an interesting interpretation of the intent of this assignment. Using DNA testing as a way to build a historical thread that can possibly reveal long-lost relatives from the past, or perhaps uncover historical facts about people that might help to strengthen filial bonds (or not!) certainly identifies an application of a current technology (genetic and genome analysis) that can be used in a very positive way. And the translation of the data collected into electronic formats will make it more likely that information converted from printed and pictorial media will be stored in a centralized place, with a reasonably high chance surviving for a very long time. You seem to be agreeing, then, that the eventual transformation of knowledge and information, including books, from the printed formats of today to more digitized forms is not only occurring, but will continue to happen until one day nearly all of our reading interactions will take place through a human-machine, electronic interface."
"One area in which this entry may fall short (as is the case with my own entry) is that a specific work is not identified. It may be helpful if an example of something like this could be found and then used as a supporting basis for the remainder of the field guide. The implication that the technology of the book and of information in general is moving toward digital is, I think, a valid one, but I for one would like to learn a little more about the specific portions of DNA components that allow us to be able to track historical genetic data and what this technology could afford us in 50 or 100 years. Also, it's always a good idea (as I'm sure you know) if our academic writing can be supported by relevant citations that support our statements and speculations. As your entry thus far is merely a rough first cut (for all of us), this is probably already in your plans as you work toward a final version!"
"This is a very good example of a current technology that is moving us closer to a time when written information is created, edited, refined, developed, critiqued, and stored in an Internet-based, 'cloud-like' environment. In a direction divergent from social-networking websites such as Facebook -- and as the author of this entry has explained -- Tumblr demonstrates one of the ways in which our book and information technology is changing from one based on printed materials to one based in a digital universe. Human interactions here are and will rely on man-machine interfaces that may eventually eliminate the need for printed copies of nearly everything. This example also welcomes wild speculation about the way humans will be exchanging information in the future!"
"Kali's selection of ""Night Film"" for her entry for the field guide is presented very well and the embedded images provide visuals that help the reader understand the unusual characteristics of this book. Although scores of other authors have incorporated illustrations, graphs, images, codes, and other visual devices to enhance the reader's experience in 'living' the story, the merging of information that provides the reader with links and other interfaces to the Internet, the importance this additional information has to the story lines and the need to download an external decoder, while possibly annoying to some readers, is in itself an example of how the current technology of the book is using the wonders of the digital age in incorporating some of its interfaces as an integral part of the book."
"This is another good example of a book that uses current digital technology to enhance a reader's interactive experience (in this case, a children's book designed to be read on an iPad using iBooks as the e-reading application. Although printed books have provided an excellent medium to display vivid illustrations and bright colors for children, it is not until books began to be digitized and designed to be read on electronic reading devices that animations, voices, and movement -- all of which greatly enhance a child's interaction with a story -- that features such as the author has described are now possible. Selecting a children's book in demonstrating possible directions for the future of books provides ample room to speculate on what may be in the realm of possibility within the next decade and, indeed, within the next century."
It does show how things we did in the past are now improved or changed as a result of technological advances. I clearly understand the point the author is making and the writing is clearly thought-out.
The field guide closely follows the prompt and finds a new type of way to engage with books through some sort of future or new technology. The guide explains the process of emerging existing texts into a more immersive reality and has made me want to download the app on mu iPhone.
"Kudos for using futuristic implementations into the field guide, like the hyperlink to News from Gardenia's Unbound site and the picture. The Field Guide does well to sell its audience on News from Gardenia which is a book about the possibility of a utopian future. The author of the guide accurately and with concise but important detail, gives an accurate description of the thing they are writing on."
The field guide describes Reddit very well and points out all the aspects of Reddit that make it something that answers the prompt's questions. The field guide creates even for someone who knows nothing about Reddit a well thought out description enabling them to use the site.
"While the Field Guide explains Reddit very well and enables the user of the guide to navigate the site with ease, its claims that Reddit is the future of books is a bit short sighted. While Reddit may be the future of DIY, self-help and information/resource based books, it will have a hard time treading in the rivers of fiction. Fiction is a huge aspect of books and text still and the Reddit community and the way the site is constructed would struggle in attempting to improve the fiction universe."
The selected thing from which the Field Guide is created follows the prompt perfectly. The description in the field guide explains what has changed in the books adaptation and these changes are a result in new technologies and advancements made.
"The technologies described definitely seem to provide a more immersive experience for the reader. Especially ""Alice,"" with its ability to provide a previously unheard of level of interactivity with the story itself. The selections point toward an emerging technology meant to work with the existing book itself to make it something new. It meets the challenges of the assignment by detailing how these products enhance the reading experience in a variety of ways (social, interactive, and reviews). It also hints toward how these technologies might be expanded upon in the future, to further change the reading experience."
The only place I can see that it falls short is that this entry is not actually about a book or something intended to replace a book. It is about a set of applications that essentially act as peripherals to a book. Similar to the way that video game system accessories add capability to the existing system. It would also have been nice to have a some information about the platforms on which these applications are currently available.
"This entry very effectively describes the ergodic text, ""House of Leaves,"" and how it utilizes unorthodox methods of story-telling to give voice to several characters. The features detailed make the prospect of reading a text of such innovative design very enticing. It is representative of how certain authors are now bushing the limitations of the traditional book to tell stories in a way few could have previously imagined."
"I do not believe this entry falls short. It effectively achieves its goal of describing this ergodic text and what books could look like in the future. I do, however, disagree that this text and those like it show the way forward for the book. I believe they are quite powerful as a novelty, as I believe printed books will become in the future. However, I don't believe they will go further than that and become an industry standard. It would be much more difficult for new authors overall to consistently produce multilayered content as a standard format. It would also get laborious for the reader and the format would no longer be unique. Ergodic literature can range from multilayered storytelling to works of art that use words as their medium. In order to remain as impressive as they are, they rely partially on the fact that the are so different from the traditional book. Additionally, while texts like these seem as though they would have to be produced as a physical book, that is not necessarily true either. A good example would be ""S."", by J.J. Abrams and Doug Dorst, as it is an ergodic text that is also available as an ebook and an audiobook."
"This sounds like an amazing companion to one of the, if not the, most popular book series' in history. The Harry Potter series enjoyed immense popularity before it ever graced a movie screen. There are few modern series' that have managed to hold the public attention in such large numbers for seven books and eight film adaptations. I can only imagine how immersive and how much fun this site would be for a Harry Potter fan. I think this description really gives the reader a sense of the level of content on the site. As well as several examples of the interesting and creative content they can expect to find when they visit it. For an fan, after reading that description, I can only imagine that their next stop would be Pottermore.com."
"Fair warning: This is my second review about this site. I feel this description did a very good job of highlighting the social features of the site and the additional literary content, in the form of fan fiction and the small additions from Rowling, which would definitely be a draw for any die hard Harry Potter fan. Combined with the continual development of additional story content in the games and the ability to stay in contact with J.K. Rowling herself. It definitely appears that Pottermore.com would be the number one place to go to immerse one's self in the Harry Potter universe."
I believe you've made a strong point here about the similarity between documentary and informational text. There is a natural connection in the way that the information is delivered. Video in a how-to or documentary style may very well replace their textbook or informational text counterparts in the future. This is one of the few types of books I believe is on the way out.
"I think the author of this entry effectively argued their point I do not have any criticism, other than that the ""future factor"" section was definitely over 150 characters."
"This entry goes in depth to explore how podcasts offer the same experience of reading a book but with the added benefit of being able to multi-task. It effectively explains what a podcast is, who uses them, and why they are important. It also uses several very specific examples to strengthen its assertions."
"The only suggestion I would have is to make mention of the millions of different types of podcasts are out there. There is truly a podcast for everybody. This would give readers a reason to seek out podcasts. I know a lot of people who are intimidated by them just because they don't understand what they are, or that there are podcasts out there that cater to their interests."
"This is an extremely well-written entry, with enough excellent description to make anybody want to read (or here, listen to) this story. It highlights a very relevant piece, one which blends the custom of stories with the ""second orality"" we are focusing on. The writer of this entry appeals to ""the illiterate and the bibliobibuli alike,"" stating the advantages of such a form of literature in the modern world. A great entry!"
"I've read and reread this entry trying to find something to suggest an improvement on, and I can't find it. This is a great entry and I think it accomplished everything it was meant to."
This is a very interesting take on the future of the book -- the focus on an interactive future is exciting. I think this entry presents an excellent argument for the futuristic digitalization of literature. It effectively describes the benefits of such technology and why it is an important option for our literary future.
"This entry wonderfully blends the arts of printed books and digital media, must like the subject itself. It is clear that the writer supports the idea of digital media as an enhancer of printed text, rather than a complete replacement, which is something I completely relate to. This entry effectively describes the content of the story without being over-revealing, and it describes the ways in which the story is a glimpse into the future of literature."
I think this entry does a great job of answering each of the questions and meeting the requirements of the assignment. I am absolutely inspired as a reader to experience this work for myself.
"I think this entry very effectively describes what makes ""Annarasumanara"" different from other e-texts, and therefore a ""future"" book rather than one we already know. The author picks out a specific characteristic of this web comic (the noticeably different format and disregard to the uniformity consistent with other web comics) to distinguish it from others and propose it as a futuristic text. It also gives readers an idea of what the web comic is about, and makes us curious to know more about the characters and story line."
"Great choice of film! I love the documentary Babies, and I think you hit upon its main unique strength here in a very eloquent way. Rather than use text at all to communicate its message, it relies specifically on non-verbal cues and images throughout the film. I really like how you mention that if you glance away for a moment, you can miss a part of the story, as that is very true for that film and for so many social cues which are non-verbal. I think this brings up all sorts of great questions, because if this film is a sort of future book it seems more a type of oral culture than literary culture. Indeed, it would seem that almost all documentary films are, in a way, more a throwback to an oral culture than literary culture. I think you've hit on an interesting idea here."
"Some quick grammar edits I noticed:
 
 Film is powerful, and ""showing"" something to a learner is much more relatable that ""explaining"" something to a learner. -- that needs to be than.
 
 Babies cry when their hungry or uncomfortable and are not capable of fending for themselves. --their needs to be they are or they're.
 
 
 
 ""Film will always be more powerful than text."" This is a huge statement, and I don't think this one film or field guide backs up this statement. Your paragraph after this begins to argue that watching something on a page would be somehow better than reading words on a page, but you don't explain why. Probably I got bristled by this just because I'm a huge reader--for me, text will always be more powerful than film. But I think it might be easier to stick to this specific film, and say why this film is more powerful as a movie than it would be in book form. It is so much easier to prove a smaller point than a larger one, and the length limits for this assignment were so limited the space is really restricted to make a larger point.
 
 
 
 Also, I love your idea of a future book, in the third part, but the instructions read to describe what makes this specific item a future book. So again, I would maybe draw back to the movie Babies and talk a bit more about what the future factor of this film is. I think you could even move the last paragraph of your summary down to that third part, and get into a bit more of the movie's documentary aspect in the middle part, an exploration of the documentary as 'book' in the middle section.
 
 
 
 Oh, also I believe you need a pic! Somewhere in there. There were so many amazing shots in that film, I'm sure you can find a great screenshot online. Or, I'm not sure if this is possible with html but I believe it is, I bet you could link the trailer here from Youtube and use that as your pic? That might give readers the best idea of the film."
"Wow, this is definitely a double-future dose. Literally future-esque, as in its subject matter, and then the figuratively future-esque of the assignment, with the Unbound Publishing. I'm a big reader and I hadn't heard of Unbound, so very cool!
 
 
 
 I love your description of the book, as you point out right away what makes the subject matter of the book unique--the isn't the same old dystopian novel, but a utopian novel where we aren't all subject to the same old gloom and doom. You point out the book's effects, that it has the ability to inspire people to make a better world, which I think is also important to make people want to run out and grab it. They know what its about, but what is it going to make them feel? So in several ways, you've found a very unique book. 
 
 
 
 I also appreciate that you are concise. In English classes I think we tend towards fancy language without saying a lot, and I think you use direct language here which conveys your message with the clarity the assignment wanted, something I know I had a hard time doing myself."
"Some quick grammar fixes I noticed:
 
 ""two hundred years in the future to a world that is recognizable yet alien""--I don't think this is grammatically wrong, I'm not sure, but I feel like ""two hundred years into a future world that is recognizable yet alien"" might read a bit smoother? Totally up to you, of course, but I just wanted to throw it out there.
 
 ""Truly a novel that inspires the reader to at least acknowledge that sustainability and human equality is possible.""--This sentence doesn't have a subject, I think it might make more sense to say ""Lllewellyn has written a novel that truly inspires the reader to acknowledge that sustainability and human equality is, at the very least, possible,"" or something like that. That authors name has so many L's!
 
 
 
 I don't have too much other constructive feedback, I think your choice of novel and why it is a future book is so right on. I guess maybe your title could be a little more powerful, but that is me straining for some more feedback to give you, to be honest. I think you have room to add some more descriptors in there, which might hook the reader in a bit more and pull them down into your assignment--your summary is so intriguing, but your title doesn't match that. Maybe: ""News from Gardenia by Robert Llewellyn is a utopian science fiction novel created, in part, by its readers.""
 
 
 
 Also, I'm not sure the sentence where you say you feel disloyal saying it isn't from the future is very clear. The whole wording of this part has to be sort of awkward as we're talking about a ""future"" book, and so it is awkward to figure out how to take about that, but you are saying it is from the future, right? So maybe ""This is from the future because"" because you aren't saying it isn't from the future? Does that make sense?"
"I love your concept of the role playing book, and I do agree that this is already happen to an extent. I think it would help if you gave a specific book that this is already happening with, as I believe this was the assignment. 
 
 
 
 So here is where I know this is happening. James Frey's new book, I believe it is called EndGame, will include a mystery with hidden gold (?) I think and an app produced by Google, so people can solve the mystery, plan on the app, and solve the game. Here is a link: http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/comic-con-james-frey-introduce-719685
 
 
 
 Google Niantic labs makes Ingress, an interactive real world game which people have written many books about, where you are battling in the real world for I think access to power points or something?"
"Some of the other concepts presented are awesome and future-esque, but this is by far the most intensely future-esque concept presented! Very cool. I'm surprised I haven't heard about this more, as it sounds so revelatory.
 
 
 
 I think each of these concepts sounds so complicated, it might be easier to focus on just Alice at it was the one that caught your attention."
"Wow, the technologies I've critiqued thus far are crazy. I had no idea the ""future"" of the book was so advanced!
 
 
 
 This is a great choice of technology to feature, as it is obviously right on the pulse of the future.
 
 
 
 I like how you mention the possibilities with children quite a bit, as I think that is important, I know many children who already use iPads as reading tools and I can definitely see this as a possibility in the future.
 
 
 
 You also managed to explain everything in an eloquent way, there weren't any grammar errors in your writing that I could find, so great job on that as you are talking about some complicated tech topics here."
"The entry strengths are good because it explains how The secret lives of Men and Women can attract to people who want rather read from the internet. It challenges the assignment because it provides reasoning on why this would be the future book, such as how people adapt to social media and how this future book can relate to it."
The entry strengths are the detail explanation about the book. It meets the challenge of the assignment because it discuss and explains how this book can be a future book.
The reader gets a full understanding of what is being describe to be the future book. It meets the challenge of the assignment because it is explained and gives a good knowledge about why the role playing game and choose your own adventure game can be the future book.
I think that this entry had good supporting information as to why it can be a future book. I think that the reader was convinced and maybe provide more information in proving the point of why it is the future book.
I really think this post was good because it provided the book information in details and that it was an ebook. It met the challenge of the assignment because their was enough information to convince the reader about the future book and why it could be.
"I think that the entry did not fall short and that its was well written with enough information for the reader to be convince. The only feedback would be about the font, It was not the regular font which is New Times Roman, that should be changed."
The strengths can be found in that there was a lot of good detail information to why the digital book is the future. It met the challenge of the assignment in proving reasons as to how the digital books will be the future books due to modern technology.
I think that the entry did not fall short and the reader was convinced that the digital books and society adapting to modern technology will enhance the demand to want digital books. I think maybe explain his question at the end.
"The author does an excellent job in summarizing the appeal of the novel itself. In addition, the way the book is created, with crowdsourced financing and increased interaction between audience and author, is a compelling way forward for future publications."
"The author does an excellent job at describing the uniqueness of the work itself, as well as the visual style of the art. The ability to alter or eliminate the restrictions of the printed page is well-explained in how the work takes advantage of the lack of limitation in electronic form."
"I'm not certain the author adequately explains the benefits of the ""lack of borders"". There is mention that ""the visual style of this story goes hand in hand with its format"" but not having read the work I'm not sure what this means, aesthetically. Likewise, ""it takes the act of reading a story and makes it almost into a film strip"" does not indicate why this is necessarily a positive development, or one that can be expanded to other works. 
 
 There is also some confusion that seems contradictory, such as ""some hosting sites have shrunk the pages down to a more ""normal"" size"", suggesting a traditional page layout, yet the author also says, ""it simply could not have been published in the old media"". A few lines clarifying this apparent contradiction would be helpful. 
 
 Overall, a focus on the effect of this borderless approach with this book, as well as ideas on how it could be beneficial in the future would be helpful."
"This field guide entry does an excellent job in explaining Tumblr and how it can be used by authors and artists to distribute their craft. It also demonstrates how this can be effective in a changing electronic landscape, incorporating both multiple forms of media and reader-response into an ongoing product."
"The author does an excellent job focusing on a single work and expanding on the method that work uses in order to demonstrate how this can be used for a variety of works. Each aspect of the expanded website is well-explained and clear, and it's easy to see how this is a useful tool to expand the world of the novel."
"I have very few criticisms of this work. Perhaps it would be beneficial to distinguish between these sorts of websites and an ""ordinary"" website dedicated to a particular piece of fiction. For example, would the myriad of fan-made websites be considered a part of this expansion of the book, or would it be limited to author-run websites?"
"I love the way you portrayed the ongoing relationship a blog can establish between author and reader in theFuture Factor section and how it differs from that of a novel. You did a great job in your description as well, and made a compelling case as to why a blog can be considered afuture book."
"My only critiques are grammatical ones. In your summary you saidpeople can subscribe to as many different ones to follow and read each entry. You have a strong voice throughout your entry, however this sentence feels awkward and could be rearranged so I it feels more cohesive with the rest of the entry. 
 
 Then, in your description, when you saidto skydive out of a plain, plain should be plane. 
 
 Thats all I got :) great job!"
"You did an excellent job with this assignment. Your descriptions were very clear and you made a compelling case as to why Pottermore is afuture book. I had never heard of it and you made me want to go check it out myself. You have a great tone to your writing that made your entry enjoyable to read. I love your last line and the idea of technology as a tool tofeed the fans, great imagery (and very accurate I believe). Fans are always hungry for more and are constantly searching for new ways to feed that hunger. Technology offers a great way for fans to connect with the author, as well as other people who have the same interests."
"My only critique is a grammatical one. In the description when you saidA animated and interactive telling of the books, a should be an. 
 
 Thats it :) great job!"
"I loved your entry! It was thoughtful and very creative. You have a great tone that makes your writing enjoyable to read. I loved the way you described the aesthetics of the book, invisible like a ghost. I also liked that you included Gaimans Halloween gift-giving tradition. That history gives the work more solidity. You did a great job in your description and made me want to go download it immediately. You also made a compelling case as to why this is aFuture Book. 
 
 Bibliobibuli is a great word by the way, I actually had to look that one up :)"
"Um...well...I really don't have much. What can I say, you did a great job. I guess you could give us a quick line describing what the story is about. I think that could make your description stronger."
This was a great entry. Your description was excellent and by far your greatest strength in this assignment. It was very detailed and I could clearly imagine the book in my head.
"Your description was excellent, but I feel that your argument as to why this should be considered afuture book was lacking. To me it felt as if you were defending it against modern technology instead of embracing it as part of our future and where books are going. I think if you removed these sentences it might help alleviate that defensive stance:Scanimation books are impossible to recreate in digital format. If one was to do so, it would entirely devalue the retro novelty and simply exist as crude animation, like an animated gif.""
 
 
 
 Also, in your description, when you said11 Iconic Scenes from a Galax Far, Far Away¦ Galax should be Galaxy."
"This was certainly the most creative idea I've read. The idea that we are all stories is one that I firmly believe. It's a great concept. I like the way you portrayed all the footprints we are creating through photographs, videos, facebook, twitter, instagram, etc. Our great grandchildren will have a far more accurate account of our story than we have of our own great grandparents. What I also like about this concept is that our stories never really end. Our story is part of our parents' story and our friends' stories and many other stories that are constantly overlapping and weaving together throughout the years."
"I thought the field draft was well written, however in terms of the book's future factor I would like to know more about why other books would follow suit. It is clearly stated what makes the book different now, but what makes it special enough to be the future for other books?"
"This entry was very interesting, particularly for those who are interested in science fiction novels. The description of the book's synopsis is what makes it really captivating. The student started their description with a question bringing the reader in as if we were reading the back cover of the book."
"It was a very good entry with very little I can find wrong. The future factor is well described and I feel I have a grasp on what Unbound is all about. Additionally, the student explained why this way of writing publishing could be popular in the future. The student also gave us a taste of what his/her full field entry will look like with a clear and well lit picture. I suppose if I wanted to see anything more, it would be more about the history/inspiration of the book."
"This entry is actually very realistic and makes a convincing argument for the popularity of orality over reading with examples of existing podcasts and other media today. Similarly, although the future factor contains a lot of hypotheses there seems to be enough realism to make it believable such the expense of printing and digital."
"The students gives a wonderfully detailed description of his/her future book. The format was thoroughly explained enough for me to understand what I would be getting into without the student actually giving away the story. The student also made a great point in their future factor about how creative format books such as ""House of Leaves"" would not be able to be e-books or digitized."
"The part about ""Alice"" met the challenge of the Assignment. I liked the idea of being in Hogwarts and walking around and looking at notes! Maybe the author could set these scenarios up in such a way that the curious are rewarded."
A very spirited campaign for the blog! I could see how reading a blog could approximate the book-reading experience for you.
Description was strong. Many good points and examples. I listen to podcasts often while working myself.
"Future Factor was strong, but it did not match Summary and Description. Future Factor section had a great idea for future book format and good points about how fast technology is moving."
This was a great example of a story in a new-ish format. It made me interested in seeing and reading the comic!
I think the subject of the field guide was well chosen. This is an interesting competitor in a very new and exciting space. You did a great job of conveying the sense of newness and excitement for the 3 different programs. I agree that interacting with books in the future could be heading in this direction.
This entry highlights a very recent innovation. The case for this being futuristic is easy to make. I don't think it is a stretch to anticipate an increase in supporting content for novels. I agree that we will very likely see more of this type of interactive website in the future.
"This entry provides a strong sense of what is means to be a future-ready book. I agree with the sentiment that readers in the future will want increased speed, technology, and convenience. The ebook or hybrid book definitely fits the speed, technology, and convenient requirement nicely."
"I love the connection to video games. Video games are growing in such a huge way that it would be easy to conceive of a distant future where movies, TV, and even literature take inspiration from them. This is a very fun and futuristic vision."
Excellent future factor! I have a few friends that hate reading and have switched exclusively to audio books(where possible). I have yet to listen to one but it is clear that this type of format is already catching on. Your particular entry sounds like an improvement on the traditional audio book. Good job.
"I loved this entry. It is hard to come up with comments here; however, if I was to try to make an argument for the future factor of audio books I would cite the increase in handheld smart phone devices, blue tooth car interfaces, and other technological advancements which make audio books easier to consume.
 
 
 
 I would be very surprised if there wasn't readily available data regarding a correlation between increase in tablets and audio book popularity."
"This entry focused on the Ideo, a really innovative technology. This entry delves into the specifics of Ideo, and the different concepts that they have developed. It is well-written, and a thoughtful post. It meets the challenges of the assignment by examining such an innovative concept."
"I really enjoyed this entry's selection for the assignment. It was innovative and interesting. The author takes a unique perspective by examining the children's book. As children thrive on constant stimulation, electronic devices are great for kids."
"This entry does an excellent job at incorporating images and text. The author clearly thought about this assignment, and the work is very well-written. The author selected an unique text, and successfully described the book's elements."
"This entry could delve into the history of the book, and how this is represents the future of the book. The assignment called for what happens in 1000 to 5000 years, so perhaps a more complete picture of what makes this ""futuristic"" is necessary."
"This entry's strength lie in the last section. The production of the book is what makes it futuristic, and it is a coincident that the book also happens to be about the future. The author was also able to include an image, which makes the post stronger. The description section was written very creatively and sounded like something you would read off the back of the book."
"This entry's strength is in thinking outside of the box. I would have never examined a Post Secret book in a futuristic manner, but I understand the logic behind it after reading this entry. This author has a detailed explanation of postsecret.com that aides in understanding the concept. Overall, it is well-written."
This entry clearly defines the Pottermore website and its attributes as an extension of the Rowling series of books. It definitely could be viewed as a futuristic technological leap for books especially this type of story that has an epic quality too it and multiple books contained within a single story line.
"There are quite a few editing errors that need to be made throughout the draft. A close reading should catch them. Otherwise, this site sounds like an interesting website for those interested in the Harry Potter series."
"I love how the author of the entry describes all the parts of the book that make it futuristic. It sounds like the book using the internet in a major way to tell the story and this integration of literature and internet technology definitely speaks to a the future direction of books. It sounds like a great read, I'll have to check out."
"This entry does a great job of capturing the futuristic essence of ""The House of Leaves."" There is great descriptions and focus on the formatting of the text in the story. This appears to be the greatest example of the book's author's forward and futuristic thinking. This too, sounds like a great read."
There really isn't much to critique in the negative of this entry.
"This entry does really great at explaining hybrid books and how they are a potential future book type. However, this wasn't the assignment. There isn't a clearly chosen book that is being described just an idea of a book type/genre."
"The strength in this entry is definitely the hard fact that this concept and company are brand new to most of us reading the entry. The description and use of persuasive language in the description was exceptional. It made me want to watch the video for a second time.
 
 This meets the challenge of the assignment because it is simply an actual attempt at a company predicting the trajectory of where the future of the book will be."
"The strength in this entry is the third section which explains the ""future factor"". While the actual product might not interest me completely, the explanation as to how it represents how we as readers can interact with a story in different ways made me want to check this story out to at least experience the different mediums. 
 
 This entry meets the challenge of the assignment because it provides us with an actual product that is being used by authors and readers today, but is only a glimpse into what is possible in this new technology."
"The strength of this entry is the writers passion for reddit. The writer seems very invested in this particular website, and states very vehemently that this site is already replacing books. 
 
 The entry meets the challenge because it is one of the specified examples in the assignment description."
"This entry's strength is it's description of the technology. While this is the second entry to describe a technology that interacts with books in the form of an app, it explains the technology in a way that I am able to picture in my mind.
 
 This meets the challenge of the assignment because it introduces the readers to a new way to interact with printed books."
"The strengths are definitely the added images. This is something that I forgot about in my assignment, and none of the other reviews that I'm doing are for entries that include pictures at all. I think that this entry did an excellent job enticing me to read the book. I agree that Pessl's ""Night Film"" can be described as a future book because of the extrasensory details that the book includes in order to involve the reader in the story.
 
 
 
 I think it meets the challenge of the assignment because it has expertly addressed every aspect of the project and made me want to go out and read this book!"
"I would have been interested to read an entry about something other than the style of books that we've already been reading in class, which is what I felt this entry felt like. I don't really have anything else to suggest, I think this article was done really well and its the best one that I reviewed!"
"This entry meets the challenge of the assignment because I believe that it is a representation of a future book, albeit for personal reasons only."
"I think that the author of this entry was feeling very strong about the book that s/he chose. This allowed for a more passionate feeling about the book which makes the reader of this entry want to read the book and to see the accompanying film and apps! I think its really cool that this book has other platforms that go along with it aside from just different pictures like we saw in ""A Dodo at Oxford"". This ties the book to more recent modes of media which I found very interesting."
"If anything, I felt like this could have used more detail in order to make it a little bit longer. The length and the voice of the entry didn't seem to go hand in hand. I felt the passion that was coming through in the writing, but then it ended before I wanted to."
I think the subject of this entry is very interesting and is something that I would enjoy taking a look at. Its also a reference to some iconic pop culture which I think will still be relevant in the future. I think this meets the challenge of the assignment because it ties together the past and the future in a way that I think could be relevant for anyone.
"I really wanted to see pictures! I loved the description of the book itself, but I wanted to actually see something instead of just reading about the aesthetics of the book. Also, this definitely needs a more concrete title. The title seems as if this was submitted on accident or out of confusion. Also, please remove ""the subject of this entry"" because that is self-explanatory."
"This entry is about documentaries with a primary focus on the ""Babies"" documentary film. I liked this entry because I felt like it gave a different spin on the project while still meeting the assignment. This is definitely an example of the future of the book. I could see people in the future choosing to watch documentaries to learn about things instead of reading books. As it is, things like furniture and special dog collars already come with DVDs to show you how to use them correctly."
"I really enjoyed the description of how Gaiman reads the script of the book. I thought the summary was straight and to the point as it should have been - easy to understand and immediately know what I was going to read about. As someone familiar with Gaiman's style, but who has not listened to this book, the description of his ""acting"" skills piqued my interested in the project and made me go and physically look up the project online after I finished reading the entry, so I feel that that aspect of the description was well done. It was also helpful to find out a bit of the background of the book, which unlike many other stories is very unique. (which was also an aspect of the assignment, just as the voice of the piece and attempting to motivate people to go and read the piece was). I also felt that the last line of the future section was particularly effective and was a lovely way to end the section by tying in themes of the Gaiman's pieces."
"I think the piece is off to a very good start, in general I think there are just a few places that could be expanded upon with some greater detail. As the author mentions the presentation of the book is unique as an audio book, so in addition the description of Gaiman's voice as the author has done which is very well done, the argument would benefit from describing how that unique experience of being read to instead of reading; not being separated from the author by your own voice, pacing, and tone of reading, or physical page, but instead almost having a ""tangible"" connection to the author and the authors voice changes the reading experience as only an audio book can. Doing so would help to further drive home the point that audio books are a entirely unique experience. I would have also like to have a scene a little bit of a deeper analysis on how audio books could expand reading in the future - again, drive home the point that this format can uniquely change the reading experience over other mediums, not just save time as the author rightfully mentioned."
"I specifically thought the description that focused on the Alice program was direct, easy to follow and clearly showed how the program furthered the reading experience through an immersive experience for the reader - it was the most effective and impactful description and really showed how books can incorporate future technology in order to evolve."
"Because the programs are very unique and many readers could be unfamiliar with their concepts I feel that the first two programs, Nelson and Coupland could have benefitted from an expanded description. I understand that the limited word space requires succinct phrasing, and the current descriptions do a fine job of describing the programs actual functions, but specific examples of something a reader could do while using the app (instead of just describing general functions) and how it would benefit the reader might have clarified the apps purpose and place in the future of the book, making the description a bit easier to understand, especially to those who are unfamiliar with the programs."
"I greatly appreciated the use of senses to describe the unique elements of the website in the description section - I also wrote about Pottermore and that was not something I had thought about including in my own description but it really helped to sell the complete atmosphere the site provides not just in content but all the way to its attention to ambiance, which is something unique to web and audio formats that can not be included in the book. The sensory details helped set the stage for the following descriptions of the types of activities users can participate in on the site, helping to show how immersive and expansive the site is and truly showing how individual it is. The summary is also very clear and direct, the reader knows exactly what the entry will be about and what to expect in the following sections."
"While I like the ideas and direction of the ""future book"" entry, I think it would benefit from a slightly stronger focus on how this can shape the direction of books and readership. The author mentions that this idea could be applied to other books and other genres, it would be worth it to consider how one could do so, how could authors make the interaction for books uniquely individual like Rowling did, and what will that do for reading - will being able to participate in such and interactive and immersive world drastically change how people read? There are several interesting and unique applications this type of site has to books in the future and I think the analysis of the future section could benefit from some slightly deeper analysis to truly convince readers how this could change reading forever."
"I thought the description of just what makes Pottermore a future book was well crafted and straight to the point. Not only did it show how it represents something new in the formatting and use of books by explaining the interactive websites use as a digital extension of the printed world to be used in conjunction with the books, but it mentioned why this was successful - people depend upon technology. In the other posts I have read, not many authors focused on why their type of book was sustainable and successful for the future of books; this post did in an well though out sentence. Such an explanation helps to solidify the potential of this type of medium and why it could feasibly be incorporated into other books and other genres as people become more and more familiar with and dependent upon technology."
"I would really have liked to see the author expand the ""asthetics"" portion of the description section. The general descriptions of what users can accomplish on Pottermore is direct and well written, but I think those not familiar with the site would be more intrigued if the author were to mention what the site looks like, how its set up (use of the sorting hat and the house systems with quizzes and games, common rooms to interact with other users in, the easter eggs in the interactive sections of the novels etc). This set-up is part of the large appeal of Pottermore and is crucial to it's success as an interactive site, so I feel that some attention does need to be given to it's physical appearance and practical uses in the description section."
"I thought the focus on the emotional reaction of the reader based on the text was intriguing and a very interesting way to show readers that the future of the books does not necessarily have to involve technology in a traditional way. The descriptions of the multiple formats and uses of texts (and their purposes) truly showed not only the versatility of font and format, but its importance, and just how deeply the presentation of words in a story can effect the readers emotional well being or reflect the state of the character or the world of the book in a visceral way. The idea that the technological advances of books does not have to mean their conversion to ebooks or their forced incorporation of technology was interesting and well presented."
"While the description of the types of fonts and formats is well presented and well reasoned, if feel including more detail of just how the use of those tools effects the emotional response/connection to the work of the reader would have helped sell the appeal of this type of book more. By just focusing on the detailed and complex uses of the font and format (while informative, important and well done in the original post) the book can come off as daunting or confusing, which may work for some readers, but in general feels like a hard sell to get people interested. By incorporating how those techniques create a unique and intriguing experience for the reader however, and why that experience of House of Leaves is unique, people might be far more willing to go into the book with an open mind and spirit and not be turned off to the idea of this type of media in general."
The strength of your rough draft is that you explained the usages of a blog very thoroughly and what a blog encompasses.
"The strength of your draft are that you clearly describe the journey of Emily C. chronologically detailing her story as a vegan, among other aspects of that such as including recipes. I also found it strong that you mentioned howe-books are the wave of the future and the items that are now extinct that once captured memories."
"The weakness of your paper is that you started off strong regarding Emily C. however finished somewhat generic with discussing an entire realm of futuristic literature. I am conflicted here because I do feel that the information you stated was important (one of the strengths I listed above) yet, I think you should find a more solid connection with Emilys journey. You mentioned that she was not associated with a publishing company, did she attempt to be published? Was publication a more difficult choice to spreading her story than e-book? I believe the convenience of publication online could be discussed, wherein that is also important to why she most likely decided to go this route, publishing a book is a confusing and long journey, yet the instantpublishing online does the job; thus the reason for so many disappearing bookstores."
The strength of your article is that you clearly described the benefits of a hybrid book and contrasted it with an actual book to where I could understand why you would prefer a hybrid book.
"The weakness of your article would be several grammatical errors, however I understood and followed what you were saying with no problem. I think your article could have had more bearing if you described one particular hybrid book."
"The strengths of your Rough Draft are that you explained thoroughly an internet news community to where I did look it up, I had never heard of it before. The problem with the claim that this is ""already the future of the internet"" is that there are so many communities of information, it is sometimes difficult to decipher which carries the most accurate information. However, you could be very right, all the information we now receive is from sources that are not well known, and are put on by anyone, so that is accurate. You did a great job of striking my interest, so, as I said, I did look up your source and I will definitely look at it again for some information."
"The only thing that I would offer as a grammatical change is to not begin a paragraph with the word ""it"". Everything was wonderful as far else as I could see. The entire assignment flowed very well and was interesting."
"Your strength in your rough draft was that you kept my interest and I desired to look up the site that you cited. Everything flowed very well and I think this is an exciting way to jump off from a book into the technology aspect, as not everyone has a computer, but if they desire to go farther than a book, they have the option to do so. Our discussion boards are very similar, as gaining insight from each other aids in our learning and understanding. You taught me something with this, as I did not know it even existed, my mother still goes to book clubs at the local library, and this would definitely prove more convenient."
"I did not find any weaknesses in your paper, as I stated previously, everything flowed very well and you held my interest."
"The motion does match the description I suppose, although I don't get the sense that the square is walking or running. It honestly just looks like it is tweeking out. The object does change colors though when its speed changes. Aesthetically, I think the program is quite pleasing."
The motion matches the description from everything that I can see. However I believe we were told to come up with some sort of description that was more story-related. In this case maybe the walker is a person with paranoia who runs when he thinks something is coming after him. Otherwise this sketch does what it is described and I love the screen wrapping.
Motion depicts the description ! running period can be increased to make it distinct.the difference between walking and running will be more noticeable apart from color change.
"The description matches the patch exactly. Great job, I like the idea of it being a bird."
The motion matches the description very well as it definitely seems like a bird is continually falling and trying to fly. the different states do a fine job to mimic this.
"The motion matched the description very well. After reading the description, I felt that the different rectangles became different people. Their movement were unique and vivid that gave the ""street""(the window) life. Also he used different color changed when a new column of rectangle showed up. Very impressive."
"Good job. The walker matches the description pretty well. I think it's interesting that the rectangle can only move in four directions rather than diagonally as well. It wasn't noticeable at first, but it's different from the class example. I also like the color changes."
"I think the description of your sketch is pretty accurate. It reminds me of fireworks rather than rockets, with all that changing colors. However, the only thing that threw me off was the mousePressed action. When I click on the screen, the trail disappears, and it doesn't seem like a rocket/fireworks anymore. Other than that, good job on the sketch!"
"The motion satisfies the purpose of the assignment, though there are no constraints to limit its movement inside the screen."
"Yes, the description matches the animation perfectly."
"Yes the sketch does match the description above for this project. I think this is a great project that had a lot of effort put into it, and the objects really do look like butterflies with various rectangle shapes fluttering around and ""showing up"" one right after the other. They do stay within a small access, while still fluttering randomly."
Haha! This is awesome and very creative. Their movements are very much like butterflies. motion matches the description.
"Yes. The motion matches the description. I liked the description, it was funny. The rectangle does exactly as it says, staggering to the exit."
"Yes it does, however I think it's Elvis ghost moving southwest because it looks very faint/ghostly the way it moves, but I loved the way that they described the movement. It moves southwest because of (-2, 1) in their code making it take the quickest exit instead of using other ""routes"" or coordinates. It also has that jumpy/zig-zag movement because it randomly jumps between (+/- 4 pixels left; +/- 2 pixels down)."
The animation matches the description and I think the changing colors as the direction changes is also a very nice touch. It matches the behavior in that the walker goes straight then changes direction as it hits a wall.
"Yes it does, it walks forward and then bounces off of the walls. I like that you used random with the colors, it makes an interesting design as it builds upon itself."
"I do recognize the rumba motion. It's a little bit too slow for demonstration purposes, but it's pretty accurate. Good job."
The both the creative description and coding description match exactly with what is occurring in this code. It is a fun description and the amount of detail you used in both explanations is very well done.
"Yes, the description matches the motion well. The red, raging parolee frantically paces in his home, quickly filling all the available space. Then it bolts from the home. It is a very nice looking animation, and becomes pretty funny when the story is told."
The behavior seems to exhibit the described actions just fine.
"Yes. The motion matches the description. It starts slow, speeds up, slows, speeds up... It worked exactly how it is described."
The patch matches the description very well. Awesome job.
"It really does. Mainly talking about the end there, you don't need an explanation to see that it looks like bubbly water spouting out from the ground. Nicely done."
The movement is a cool and funny one and it meets all the requirements.
It sure does match it. The description is pretty clever and fitting to what I saw. Good job!
"Yes. The walker acts normal within a specific area until prompted, and then returns to normal afterwards. I like the mouse movement incorporation."
"I think this patch excellently mimics the description given. Upon reading the description I was a bit skeptical as to whether or not it would look like the motion. But when loading the patch, it fits it very well and is also extremely entertaining to interact with."
"I sort of see it. It's very quick on how it reacted to seeing a celebrity, but it seems calm most of the time. It looks like the walker object continues going in random directions and it doesn't head back to its cosy little area."
This is one of my favorites; it's very different. You did a really good job depicting the fluttering wings and the basic movement of a fly. Good job.
"Yes, the motion matches the description well. It is obviously a fly. While sometimes the fly flies backwards, the twitchy erratic flight and the size changes really sell it."
"The motion perfectly matched what was written in the second question. The fly changes states every 2.5 seconds, and it has the four different actions. The only thing is that it wasn't a rectangle, but as the student wrote, the ellipse just looks better."
The sketch exhibits the described behavior very well.
"Yes it does match the description above. The lines of squares are moving from the top to the bottom right corner looking like a lightening bolt. I also like the transparent blue that they made. When I clicked the mouse and held it down the squares turned red, but when I released it went back to blue."
"The actions of the walker are described well, my only suggestion is when the walker goes off screen have it come through the other sider and not towards the middle."
"it does. What I would change about it, though, is that I would reset the squares on random points of the width as well. This is because when life sets you back, it can either be a little or a lot. Also because after a while, one side of the screen is left blank, making it look kind of lopsided. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 P.S. When I played it at first, it shaped out would looked like a running fox with a flaming tail. Thought that was cool."
The walker matches the behavior in that it stays still while moving slightly for a while before 'jumping' to a close by area. With the strokeWeight it gives the walker a cool fading effect that adds to the jumping idea.
Good job! The walker matches the description very well. It moves in a small area for a short while and then jumps to a new spot on the screen. It was obvious that the code was original and easy to understand.
The description and behavior definitely match though there isn't really a story behind it. Maybe the spiral represents a bug flying in a spiral towards the screen but then dies cause it hit the screen. However I really love the coding you did for this. It looks beautiful.
"Yes, it does create the look of hand drawn spirals. I thought your use of expanding the radius was neat."
"Your description of what is occurring is not done in the way that was asked. You did describe it correctly, but just not as a character in a movie. However, the creating of spirals is really cool and entertaining to watch."
"Description and actual sketch look to be matching, but it's not described as if it was a character in a movie.
 
 This is also a really cool design. Great job!"
"Yes, it does, I like how you were able to use the millis(), I had a hard time understanding how to make that work."
"The motion described is actually described pretty well, and with your description it actually made the program come alive more than it normally would. You used the colors of the rect to help the viewer go deeper into your narrative, and it helps the viewers imagination create a world in their own heads using your sketch, This is a good mix of art and programming."
"I really like the creativity in the description. I think the description was made to fit the animation, but I feel it works here. The animation does display the erratic behavior of the scenario you presented. Visually, it is very fun, although the rapid switching between grays can be a little displeasing to watch."
"The assignment matches the description, it works well in that the rapid movements are done with larger squares while the smaller circling movements are matched with smaller squares."
"The sketch was quite unexpected. I had expected a large rectangle travelling down the screen and found one that was small and nearly transparent. However, I like how well it matches the actions of a parachute explorer. The response in question 2 matches the behavior of the rectangle as like that of the parachute explorer, giving me a better sense of what is happening on the screen."
"Simple and straight to the point, this patch was fun and easy to use. The primary sound was simple but slightly annoying (perhaps like a good 'no' sound should be. The surprise of the 'yay' when I found the yes key was extremely pleasing and the the fireworks certainly added a cool surprise."
"Simple structure but effective, the added graphics were great but unexpected because they had not come up in class as an option within the creative process of this software. Seems like I am learning a lot about what the possibilities for more user friendly interface design. My only critic was that the buttons at the bottom could have been lined up more symmetrically."
It's wonderful. The sounds are entertaining and grasp the meaning of positivity and negativity.
The approach is perfect. I learned that UI and presentation mode in Max is very critical to developing a successful patch.
"The header is very creative, presenting the challenge of attempting to locate the good key. It presents a nice, inviting title and lays out the challenge before you while still being minimal. The master sound button is a great idea, saving the viewer a little time by not having to scroll down and switch each individual sound button on. The logistic part of the patch, though, is much the same as we were presented in class, with a little extra fuddle and detracting clunkiness included."
"Once the master sound button has been toggled to active the process becomes as simple as pressing different keyboard buttons until the right one has been pressed.; in this case it is ""P"". The sounds are clear in relaying to the user the information of the keyboard button, good or bad, but seem like stock audio samples that lack originality and are devoid of personality infusion on part of the programmer. The design is nice, but the sounds aren't entertaining to hear repeatedly, so after two/three times, I stopped the program."
"The introduction of the header and master audio switch is a novel idea that is aesthetically pleasing and improves immensely the ease with which the viewer can control the program and use it correctly. The presence of the links between the different objects, necessary as they may be, slightly detract from the quality of the header and switch button. The actual working part of the program seems slightly clunky due to the zigzagging wires crossing through one another and the yes/no button signals. The organization of the patch elements and including more novel sounds will make the patch perfect."
"While I was using this patch, I was very confused by the good key and bad key sounds. The sound for the bad key element did not sound as negative as I would want it to be. The good key element, with the sound being a bell ringing, was a good choice for determining what the good key was but, the choice for the bad keys was questionable with it being just a simple drum hit."
The way how this patch was approached was the same way as the patch that we went over in class. Something that was different that I saw was the addition of the comment speech bubble. I did not know that that was a way that comments can be presented and is definitely something that I learned.
The patch is very simple and it's easy to understand the signal flow.
"It has a logical flow, but there are two ending speakers that it can lead to. This could have been simplified. There is only one comments, and it is not specific enough if the person is unfamiliar with the program."
The patch looks very clean and well put together.
"The patch works perfectly, the D key plays back a ringing bell while all the other keys play back a snair drum."
"The patch is impressive and works well, I think that they even added in some extra steps along the way that made the patch even a little cooler."
"The patch feels simple and clean, seemingly trying to be easily understood rather than technically efficient."
"It feels great to use. The sounds are simple and quick, making it easy to identify what key I've hit. The sounds end quickly which gives enough of a response to know if I hit the right key or not."
"The patch uses two different sfplay~ objects, one for success and one for failure, which makes the patch look easier to understand even if not as technically efficient. I've learned that simplicity can come from making it technically less simple, although it's not surprising or exciting. I am not sure what could have been done better."
The patch looks simple and logical.
"The experience is simple and mechanical with little conceptual salience, but there's still a sense of elementary investment in the patch's function. I'm happy when I hear the ""success"" song instead of the ""failure"" song."
"There isn't any major technical innovation here, but everything works fine."
The look of the patch is very organized and easy to understand.
"No, while the assignment was very organized and clean, they didn't really do anything exciting. I didn't learn anything from it. They couldve added extra sounds to make it better."
Very simple and easy to read vertically from top to bottom. Same as in class.
"The patch looked very nice and professional. It seemed to contain all the correct pieces and buttons so based on appearance, I would give it an A."
"I thought the sounds were very creative. Now I had my volume on super loud so my first press and the ""W"" key was a bit shocking but after the initial shock I was good. The sounds themselves were actual song pieces which I really enjoyed. It was entertaining, energetic, and I would have fun playing around with this patch."
"This particular patch looks very professional to me. It is as cleaned up as it can be. As I have said, I did enjoy the fact that they added songs in place of a voice for the yes and no key. Did I learn how it was done based on the patch itself, no. However, I am no eager to do so. Honestly, there is not much more to be done to this patch to perfect it. It's self explanatory and easy as can be."
The folder wasn't labeled so I had to open it to see who files I was looking at. The patch was very simple and clean. There are a couple of toggles that I didn't see the purpose for.
The patch was simple and easy to navigate. The sounds are entertaining.
I found the coding to be basically the same as shown in class. The two extra switches I thought maybe could have been removed. The sound was original as well.
"The patch appears to be very nice, and well put together."
The patch works fine and emits both a yes and a no sound.
When getting the right key it plays a sound very similar but more inviting then when hitting the wrong key.
The patch is good it takes two different types of sound to play which is a good mix.
this is a good patch it combines two different type of sound and its cool to listen to.
"This patch is another short and simple patch but i feel like it needs more room to be able to see more clearly, since it is a short assignment it does not hurt to spread them out a bit more."
The buttons used are great and they get the job done right with the sounds. The no sound is a simple gong which is better than just saying no and the yes button is cheerful music like the type you receive when you beat a level in a video game.
The program worked perfectly and it was interesting to hear different sounds and nothing repetitive. All they have to do is spread their projects out more in future projects.
This patch was very clean and put together nicely. All components were accurately described and neatly placed.
"When running the patch, I couldn't get the sounds to play unless I clicked the ""ezdac"" object. This may be a Max thing though, so I wouldn't discredit the creator for it. Prior to critiquing, I had been listening to music, so when the evil laugh played, I actually jumped a little in my seat because it was so loud. I got a laugh out of it, and smiled fondly when I found the right key and recognized the Beavis and Butthead(or what I assumed them to be) laughs. The sounds are goofy with a touch of terror that still has my heart pumping a bit from the surprise. One thing is for sure, I'll be turning my sound down a bit when moving on to the next critique."
"The patch was pretty standard in terms of technical setup. It followed the tutorial correctly. As mentioned above, the maniacal laugh was pretty surprising. I cant imagine what people with headphones might have done. The sounds chosen did get a bit annoying after multiple key presses, so using multiple laugh tracks might help with the monotony that tends to occur after multiple attempts. In the future I might suggest labeling your files with your name or some kind of identifier - especially if an instructor is going to be looking at it."
It's very simple. Text states clearly how to make the patch function and what it will do.
"It's entertaining. The laughter provokes memories. The ""bad key"" is kind of creepy while the ""good key"" is humorous."
Pretty simple patch. Not complicated to look at.
The good key is pretty entertaining with the beavis and butthead laugh.
"Looks similar to the example in class, easy to follow, uses the open features along with the names of the files."
"Very entertaining to use, made me laugh just like the patch did, and it was easy to tell which key was the odd one out."
"The audio was the most surprising thing, most of the patch looked similar to the class example but it was the audio that made it unique."
It's pretty basic and straightforward. Lots of notes to let you know what's going on. Simple.
The look and feel is simple.
"The ""no"" sound was startling, and the ""yes"" sound was comedic and nice to hear."
"The ""yes"" key wasn't a letter, but a number key, which I thought was interesting."
"It feels like the 'no' feedback sound is too long and drawn out, yet the 'yes' sound is great and entertaining. It leads to a really annoying experience until I get the right key."
Looks and feels very similar to the patch built in class.
the good key sound is very entertaining.
"Before even using the patch, I could tell that program would run smoothly. It was well laid out and designed, nice and clean."
"After playing with the patch, I thought it was fun. I liked the user's sounds a lot. I could tell the user is a goofy person because when you found the good key, it played the ""oooh-yeah,"" from Ferris Bueller's Day Off."
"The patch technically speaking was basically the same layout as instructed in class. However, they did a good job overall. I especially liked the sound files."
The patch was neat and organized. But a few of the pieces like the buttons didn't need to be there.
"Technically, the patch worked perfectly, but there was nothing exciting about it."
"It's a very simple lay out. Very bare bones, and minimalistic. No real explanations to what everything does, outside of the 'good' and 'bad' buttons, but the path to each part if pretty easy to figure out."
"There was some key hunting, and the 'no' sound, which was from Sonic, was a little grating to the ears after a while because of how loud it was being played. The 'yes' sound highly amused me, the victory sound from any given Final Fantasy game. It did feel like a victory after finally finding the 'good' key. It was a nice experience overall."
"Technically, it wasn't anything complicated, and nothing experimental about it. Because of how simple it was, I didn't learn anything new and nothing jumped out at me. Which is fine since the path to each part was laid out to where it should be. Maybe adding a level meter in just to give the user an idea of how loud everything is, and possibly making sure before using a sound that it's not too loud for the user. Other than that, it was a pretty good patch."
the victory sound was a bit too long. but i felt like i watching a movie intro or playing a game
it was pretty simple only thing i would have done differently would be shortening the victory sound file
"The patch is very clean, everything is laid out in straight lines and is extremely easy to understand. There are no unnecessary elements in the patch."
"The bad key sound is extremely annoying so it really makes you want to find the right button quickly. I also liked how the good key's sound went on for a rather long time. It gave me a sort of Super Mario feel, similar to when the game is beaten and the credits start to roll."
They didn't do anything exciting or surprising but they made the patch as simplistic as possible and I almost think that's better than any extra elements. It makes it so the patch is very easy to read and the user can understand everything that's taking place.
"It's a very simple patch, it's easy to understand the signal flow."
"The failure sound is really annoying, I suppose that it makes the user more motivated to find the success sound, but the game requires hearing the fail sound over and over. It would be better if it was a softer, shorter, less annoying sound, or had volume controls so I don't have to endure it."
"This patch is very simple and easy to understand, but it isn't very user friendly. Adding a few comments to tell the user to load the sample and turn on the sound, for example, would make the patch easier for the user."
"The patch is a simple variation of the assignment, and looks very clean. It is structure neatly from top to bottom and I know how the patch flows."
"The bad key is bad indeed, it makes you want to hurry and find the good key. Now the good key is rewarding, I do believe it is from a video game and I cannot recall which but hearing it makes me feel as though i just beat an intense level of some sorts."
"The patch was simple and straight forward with an ease of design. They did add a ""victory"" and ""loser"" aside to a ""yes"" or ""no"" which added to the whole video game music choice. I did do a similar design and structure."
"Surprised to see something so simple, was expecting something a little more elaborate. In general it was aesthetically clean and pleasing."
"Very easy to use and the instructions in the information box made it clear as to what to expect. The sounds worked well, somewhat goofy but entertaining. Generally effective even though slightly over simplistic."
"Seems as if they recreated the very minimum technicality needed to fulfill the requirements of this projects, fortunately the sounds were entertaining. After looking at the sub patch I realize that there was a bit more thought put into than I realized. Appreciated being able to go in and look at the inner workings of the project. May have been fun to have some other sounds included. Always learning, realize I am going to have to up the ante next time!"
This patch looks different from the other ones I've looked at so far. It was definitely interesting. I would assume this person has prior knowledge of Max as this patch appears to be a bit more advanced. It was set up as a project with multiple folders instead of a single patch.
"I learned how to select multiple keys/values using the select object, which was something I was trying to do when creating my patch, and for some reason I just couldn't get it to work. Despite my confusion, I think this person did a pretty good job on the assignment. They achieved something completely unique to what I have seen so far. My one suggestion would be to find clearer and possibly shorter sounds."
"I think that the patch that you made is pretty clean, and unique. I didn't see the selective key in that which is an excellence idea to hide it."
"I think that the sound quality is a little bit poor, so I can hear a lot of noise. The style of the music isn't in my area of interest, but I think it's pretty cool."
"I think that the coolest thing of your work is that you used the sub patch, so you are able to hide the ""Good key"" form the user."
simple yet obviously complex
0
they did something nobody else did. a step up from the orig. assignment.
"This look is completely different from the rest of the patchers i have seen today and it is very unique and makes me wonder what it will do, it comes with instructions on how to use it and it has a short simple design."
I eventually got it to work after reading the instructions carefully but overall the patch itself looks short at a glance and there is a sub patch that actually does all of the work in it and i think that is pretty fancy.
Pretty simple patch. Not complicated.
"The patch looks well organized in terms of visually clean, the connectivity of the patch is very sharp and visually appealing. The terms associated with the yes, patch are sounds that would be an obvious strong indication of the, positive, ""yes"" or negative ""no""keys. Prior to interacting with the program I couldn't actually see the speaker connected to the rest of the model or the meter."
"The functionality is simple to use, which is great. There was a voice recording of the word hallelujah and a voice recording of word your wrong. Even when I had my volume on high they were still hard to hear, and the word, ""your wrong"" was very hard to make out. I think the simplicity of the words chosen is good because it is obvious as it relates to this project. I feel the user experience would be straight forward in terms of the literal, ""good key/bad key"" assignment."
"Technically the patching looks fine. It looks like the assignment was followed exactly, the only thing I did not see was the meter. I did not see anything out of the norm in terms of a new feature or function that was not assigned. I really do like the visual aesthetics were very appealing. I did not learn anything new from the way the programming was completed. I think would could have possible been improved was just the recording sound of the wave files, they were just really low."
"The patch is clear and easy to use. I like that there is a button that I can press to activate the wav files instead of hunting for thegood Key, or an ascii code map. I like the meter and the level meter attached to the sfplay object, it helps to know that the sound is playing."
"It is cute and funny. I like that the bad key sound is ""aint nobody got time for this"" and that when you find the ""good key"" it rewards you with a strongyea!. The sounds were very fast and clipped very tight. It made it feel abrupt."
"I like the patch, it is clean and simple. I like the color sound meter."
I love the sound. The audio is an actual person talking not just tones.
The overall feeling I got when looking at the patcher was that it was cleanly laid out. My personal preference would be to line up the edges of the bottom boxes with the edges the message patches above. A minor point!!!
I figured out how to open finally!!! Catchy recordings
"It is small and compressed, which I like, but the opening window was very large. It it clean and well placed, easy on the eyes. However, there are no comments, which would make it difficult to follow."
0
"The coding assignment was formatted and completed the same way as it was done in class, but there was an additional sound meter added.
 
 
 
 They could have left comments such as what key number 97 is."
"I think that the patch that you made is clean, and well organized."
"I love the music that you picked. The quality of the sound is pretty good, and the style is really unique, and not clichÃ©. I'm really enjoy playing this interactive."
"I think you did a good jobs, and also picked a really impressive music, however I think that you might be able to try something more advance or more creative."
"Looks like the class example, clean and easy to read. only thing that differs a bit is the volume control."
"Feel very simple to use, the only thing was the volume control has a setting so at first even when I turned the speaker on I couldn't hear it. After a little time I was able to figure it out."
"The sounds varied a bit compared to the class example, it was a little more pleasing then hearing just ""yes"" and ""no"" over and over again."
"It was approached in a different way than what the lecture taught, which is always welcome. What the creator could do is to explain the features of the patch so new users don't get lost on it."
The sounds didn't work for me at first and I had to mess with the live.gain~ function before it made any noise. The actual audio clips were nice and soothing.
"They used the live.gain~ operation, which I was unfamiliar with, so it's cool that they tried something different. But it didn't play sound at first which is basically all it needs to do. They are also the first person who didn't have the YES key blatantly showing, so that's great."
It is minimalistic and neat. It feels easy to follow if you know introductory knowledge of Max/MSP.
"I'd say it feels like the ""average"" good key bad key game where you quickly sort through the key choices until you find the right one, guessing roughly where it might be based on the key print feedback. It feels a bit more beautiful than goofy based on the audio feedback. It still leads me to feel mildly amused and more engaged with playing with the audio as it's a bit more appealing."
"This is another bare bones basically and neatly structured patch. If they wanted to do more they could have used background colors, made the key a bit more difficult to find with key combinations, and other slightly more complicated additions to the game."
i couldn't get it to work with keyboard buttons just the on screen buttons but i liked it still and the sounds were simple yet effective
"Did not work. There was no operator to select a good or bad key. The wav files were pleasant to listen to, a soft ""hello"" and ""goodbye"" with a very nice voice. It made me want to use the patch but I could only press the open operator to make the patch play a sound."
The patch looks well organized though I am not entirely sure the purpose of the boxes that say what is.. and awkward. It is easy to understand the flow of the code.
"I was not able to make any sounds happen, and I did not see a select function used so the program seems to be struggling to complete the required code. It is easy to see where I am typing, however."
"It was fairly straight forward so I did not learn anything new in the coding. I think to do this better the author could have added the select message to operate the program to make sound. I think the clarity was well accomplished, and in the future they can focus on being more technically intense."
Code not complicated.
"They did the basic requirement, but I was unable to trigger the actual sounds."
"Feels like the class example, simple to read, and this one has text boxes with directions which make it a bit easier to read."
"Sounds were entertaining, I enjoyed the ""whoosh"" a bit more than the ""yes and no"" shown in the example."
The patch looks nice but with a few extraneous pieces. Unfortunately there is a note telling me exactly which key is the right one so I didn't have to look for it. It kind of defeats the purpose of this patch.
"Technically, the patch was perfect. Though there was nothing original about it except the sounds, it did what the assignment asked."
The feel of this particular patch is very clean cut and to the point. The symmetrical alignment of the objects helps create a simple yet effective vibe.
"The coding assignment was very similar to the screencast. The one exception being that they placed buttons before the 'open' messages. For someone who was unfamiliar with Max or any kind of code, I felt it enhanced the patch from a visual aesthetic and also let the user clearly see what the patch was doing. I think that this was where I was forced to wrap my mind around something. Some could argue that the buttons are unnecessary and it might have a pure simplicity without them."
Both 'yes' and 'no' give a response that I would expect. The 'yes' is positive and the 'no' is negative.
"The student added in an extra tool for showing the audio level, yet besides that, there is nothing surprising or exciting. It seems that they tried to add more to it, even with the little we have learned in class. It's hard to say what could have been done better."
"The patch is laid out well, and looks nice. There are lots of comment boxes and everything is a nice distance away from is each other."
The sounds are movie quotes and take longer amount of time to run than the other sound bits. The meter and levelmeter both light up and provide a visual feedback as well as the sound.
"I really like how things are laid out in this patch, it is pleasant to look at. They did show the winning key however, which doesn't make the game much 'fun'. There are some added functions like the meters which give the patch more personality."
"I think that the patch that you made is really clean, and well organized. I also saw that you have a decibel meter to measure the sound, which is really cool to me."
"I think that the sound that you picked is really funny, so I'm really enjoy using it."
"I think you did a good jobs, and also picked a really funny music. The most impressive thing in your project is a decibel meter to measure the sound, however I think that you might be able to do something more creative."
"This patch is neatly arranged. I noticed that in addition to the regular meter, they also had a level meter, which was new."
"I think the sounds used where really unique. I was thoroughly amused by both the Spongbob and Austin Powers soundbites. I seem to enjoy the projects that can make me laugh more than the others, and this one definitely did the trick. The patch was straightforward and easy to use. I found myself searching for the right key even though it was outlined in a comment, just to keep hearing the sounds."
"Aside from the sounds and extra meter, I'd say this patch was pretty run of the mill. I didn't really see a use for the extra meter, but it did add a little extra visual component to the project. One thing I think could be improved is that there was a little extra length of ""noise"" at the end of the yes soundbite and that probably could have been trimmed off."
"The yes sound nice, but the no sound is the sound that most macs make when pressing a wrong key so I was confused for a second. That was clever actually. 
 
 The buttons lit up in different colors, that was a good idea."
"Nothing here really surprised me, I liked the colors on the buttons. And the sound choice made me think I was not even clicked on Max so yeah that was a good idea."
"It looks pretty basic, with some added features like the meter and color feedback from the bangs of incorrect and correct key choices."
"It's amusing that they used the traditional mac error sound and the other sound for the correct key press was generally pleasing. It feels pretty easy to use, mildly aesthetically and audibly pleasing and neatly organized. It gives a pretty good experience, but this game gets old pretty quickly after you've played it a handful of times."
"They did more than the minimum for this assignment so kudos for going through the little extra effort to beautify your patch. I learned I could easily have added color to my patch for a slightly more pleasing experience. Also, people will definitely hate my ""wrong"" sound and that's sadistically pleasing."
"Overall, the design was fairly simple with very few alterations to what the instructor created in class."
"The sounds were entertaining to listen to; ""Funk.wav"" was pretty funny to listen to."
The look and feel was simple.
"The patch was simple, one ""yes"" key."
At the moment I cannot hear the sound files of any of the programs because I am not on a Mac I think. Patch appears to be working correctly based on the buttons lighting up.
The approach was pretty straightforward ad followed the in class instructions.
"At a glance the patch looks good, there is plenty of room and space for it to be seen without confusion and it comes with some handy tips and comments on how to get it to work if you do not find the key it has the answer so it does not frustrate you. The overall look is simple yet amazing."
One of the sounds was funny it made me chuckle but the no sound was a simple no which i would of preferred it to make another sound other than the obvious no or incorrect try again.
The patch overall worked perfectly and it was amusing and it follows the assignment just right when it comes to requirements and layout. I actually did learn how and where they acquired the sound bar from because i could not find that for my project which i know would have been helpful for those who maybe could not hear it.
The overall feel of the patch is very technical and clean. The patch looks similar to the one done in class and has nice layout.
The sounds are goofy and funny. They make you want to do the patch over and over again because the sounds are entertaining to listen to. It leads a very pleasing and funny experience for the user.
They approached the coding assignment very typically. The patch looks similar to the tutorial done in class. They added the meter for extra flare. I did learn that I should have used more comments in my own patch since it can be very confusing without them.
Looks very basic.
It was kinda funny. The militaristic samples rose a chuckle out of me.
They did the basic requirement.
conceptually it was compartmentalized.
goofy. the sounds used are goofy.
"The patch was clean and simple, once again I noticed the extra toggles. There was no media lines used so it felt kind of plain."
"I only got one of the sounds to trigger - the ""no."" The Ace Ventura sounds were cool and all, but only if it actually works."
"The patch looks very good, and is condensed a lot. But still looks like it took some technical abilities to make."
"The patch works great, and responds to the keys accurately."
"The sounds are awesome and unique, this is a very well done patch."
"This patch is very simple, and it's easy to understand the signal flow."
"Firstly, the sounds are fantastic. The creator expertly utilizes the concept of ""cuteness"". Even though the patch is very simple, the fact that it makes ""human"" sounds gives it an air of humanity."
"The patch is very simple, but the creator could have added a few things to make it easier to the user. Firstly, comments that tell the user to turn on the sound, for example, would make is user friendly. Secondly, adding a few features like the ability to pick the ""success"" key would be a great feature for this patch."
"Visually this patch is extremely sharp looking. The cable line that he used to connect the components look like a piece of art work in itself, with a very mechanical feel. The patch looks very straightforward and user friendly, and followed the guidelines of the assignment exactly."
"I thought the user experience was overall very strong with this patch, not only from visual aesthetics, but from the functionality as well. The sounds were entertaining, especially the good key. The sounds were definitely goofy, which make the user interface more fun."
"This patch was techinically very visually creative and functionally as well. I did learn to try to stretch myself creatively in terms of trying to program my patch to have an artistic quality as well, and not just merely connect components for functionality purposes, included stretching creativity in sounds waves as well. I do not really have any recommendations for improvements, I think they did a great job."
"The sound was sort of boring at first...but then I found the ""yes"" button and it made me laugh for quite a while, good use of the file."
"Coding was very similar to class example, easy to follow, and it had quite an entertaining outcome."
The patch itself gives off a very good feel. It was not as clear as some of the others and at first it looks like they may have missed a step but they just simplified it to the very core.
I really liked this patch. It was super creative and the sounds were perfect. The good key sound is one that continues on its own for quite some time so its as if it is actually speaking to you and I personally thought it was very funny. This particular patch makes me want to try harder and make more creative and funny sounds.
"The patch followed the guidelines perfectly. This patch did not contain each step by step explanation for each button which I have been used to seeing. However, it works perfectly, it is still easy to navigate and I don't think anything could have been done differently."
Simple and not as developed as it could have been. On a positive note it was not intimidating.
"Basic concept, kind of monotonous and it took me while to find the 'yes' key! The redeeming factor was the 'yes' sound was crazy and strange and interesting which made it worth the wait."
The patch looks very simple. Easy to understand what is intended.
"I was not able to get the patch to run. However, the description that was provided makes the patch seem like a very neat idea. I liked that the idea was musical and hope to see something like this that works."
"The patch was approached as expected. However, the way that they used musical elements was particularly interesting."
"Looks good, everything all lined up. I like it."
"There was a really cool and neat idea in the patch that somehow along the way didn't come through. I don't know if something had a wrong path, or something. I did see two message boxes before the speaker, so I don't know if that was the problem or not. The idea was exiting, but sadly I couldn't hear it."
Clean looking patch
I felt like I was in Vegas for a minute.
"Visually logical and simple, including colored buttons indicating ""correct"" and ""incorrect"" input."
This is perhaps the most basic incarnation of this particular assignment. The sounds are predictable and obvious in their connotation.
"Nothing about the patch is surprising from a technical perspective, but it works well."
"Nicely laid out, and the two buttons, one for 'yes' and the other for 'no', are color coordinated for the user's convenience. Everything is labelled, and even which key is the 'good one' is spelled out as to leave out the guess work."
"It was a quick experience, but pleasant. The sounds were not obnoxious and nicely leveled. The sounds were traditional positive and negative sounds for guesses, so it wasn't an out of the ordinary experience."
"Technically, it was a simple setup, and nothing too out of the box. Everything worked as it should, and when it should. Nothing exciting, and nothing boring or unusual. As for what could be done better, I got nothing since everything worked and everything was laid out as it should."
"I enjoy the use of different color buttons for notifying when the Good/Bad key is struck. Very simple, easy to navigate."
It feels very simple to use. It's stated exactly what you have to spell out in order to hear both sounds and activate the good/bad key. I enjoy the sounds.
They approached it as we did in class except they added buttons with different colors for visually informing when a good/bad key is struck. I learned that the colors of the buttons can be changed to give a visual representation of when keys are struck.
"I like the concise look and minimal use of space. The author still gives the message, but without a lot of looking around. It feels like the author copied the template, made it more concise, and added their own versions of yes and no."
It is easy to use though I had to do some guessing to find the good key. I enjoyed the futuristic sounding files and it reminded me of space mountain. It would be well used with some kind of space ship cockpit.
I think they completed the assignment as asked without adding a lot. The buttons are a nice addition to see which side your typing is going through. It adds a good visual cue in addition to the audio output.
"So far this patch is the smallest I've seen. Everything is very condensed which almost makes it look clustered but also gives the patch a sense of unity. It's very clear everything works together and makes the patch seem like a whole thing rather than a bunch of parts working together. This aesthetic is very interesting, I haven't seen it before."
"This one was actually a lot of fun! I loved how the good key's sound started off the same as the bad key's. I can definitely see someone just pressing the keys one after another and completely missing the sound, which is amusing to imagine. The sounds overall reminded me of the inside of a sci-fi movie spaceship."
I think the way they organized the patch was surprising; a lot of people had their patch spread out far apart and made sure the user could separate the different parts easily. This patch sort of bunches everything together giving it a new feel. I don't think there's anything they need to do to improve their assignment.
"The patch itself is pretty good, the sounds are funny and entertaining. Its a decent patcher but I actually did have to hunt down the specific good key which took a little time but then again that is the point of this assignment so all in all its a delightful patcher. The space sounds blew me away."
"This patcher followed all the right rules and components of this assignment. I still suggest spacing out the buttons/keys to look better and cleaner. In this case, I would also advise on stating which key is the good key for the sake of time for this critique assignment. But it still played the sounds and functioned perfectly."
"Very simple, I like it."
The sounds are entertaining. It's a bit confusing that the sound is used for both good key and bad key. At first it made me think I had pressed both keys or there was an error in the way it was coded. I then realized the same sound is used within the good key sound as the bad key sound. It's very easy to use and navigate.
It looks nice and simple. Very small and compact.
"The experience was OK. The sounds were fairly interesting although it was a little confusing. For some reason I though the wrong key was the right key, but that just may be how I took the sound effect."
"Like I said before, it was done very simply. Which is always good. The simpler the better. However, I kinda would have liked to see comments of some sort. If I had no idea what was going on, I would be incredibly lost. Honestly, I didn't really learn anything new from this patch."
at first glance the patch looked complicated. however the patch notes were helpful.
This patch was very entertaining. it almost had a soundboard feel and I just wanted to make custom mixes of train sounds.
the patch uses the same formula shown in class but adds more sound and key options.
It looks fairly organized and well constructed. It feels very straightforward and efficient.
"I think it works very well. The sounds are cool and offer a kind of variety, so that was nice. The experience was always unique due to the variations in the sounds which made it that much more entertaining."
"I think the patch looks really cool. I learned a few new things like the counter. As I went through it, I thought of ways to make it simpler, but Overall, I think it looks really good. Great Job!"
"The patch was pretty entertaining to work with and would be something fun to use for a kid. Although, when I was working with It I was confused with what keys I was pressing to make the different sounds. The sounds weren't necessarily ""good"" or ""bad"" therefore I think the keys I was pressing should have been more straight forward but they felt random."
"I think you did a very good job technically working on this. Although the code was confusing to me, after I played around with the sounds for a while it was easier to see how it works. You also did a good job explaining the changes that you made, making it easier to understand. After looking at your code and the changes made on it from what we did in class, I learned a few new ways to connect the keys and make it so there is multiple ""good keys"" and ""bad Keys""."
"Kind of confusing. It seems as though Tom tried to create two different Good Key Bad Key patches and put them together to form one. It seems that he experimented and tried to create a more advanced, more complex version of what we made in class."
"I appreciate the fact that Tom tried to do something different with his project and expand upon what was taught in class, but I do think he could have organized it better and chosen sounds that aren't extremely similar to each other. There is just a lot going on in this patch and I think it should have been simplified."
The sounds are simple and not very entertaining in my opinion. The good key is kind of exciting but runs a bit longer than I'd like it to. The experience I get is just wanting to press many different keys over and over
the experience is very simple but it works.
Simple to look at. Nothing different or unusual about the patch. Basically what we learned in class. There were no comments on the patch to let me know what the good key was.
"I liked the music patch of the good key, it went well with the symbol sound of the bad key. There was definitely a reward there for the effort to find the good key."
Technically simple. I would have liked an overlap of sound that two speakers would have given the patch. It would have made it more fun to use.
"The aesthetic look of the patch is appealing and it has all the components with some of the other patches have been missing. The design of the patch is predominantly on a vertical plane, but here is uniformity and it looks balanced with how the components were placed. It looks user friendly and well defined."
"The visual appearance is definitely uniform and appealing conceptually by the simplicity of the design. It definitely allow for a user interface that is not intimidating. I really like the sounds in this patch, they are entertaining. The bad key, had the wah, wah, wah zany sound effect, which is definitely a fitting sound for this key. They good key was great, it reminded me of being in an amusement park riding on a roller coaster."
"I think the coding was approached very well within the constraints of the assignments, meaning there was no other new or different technical components. However, it looks like they really did master the patch that they did complete. The only improvement I could make is to be more aware of the artist element of design within the patch. For example, the cables connecting the components could be connecting in a way to create more of artist representation of the piece."
"I think that the patch that you made is really clean, and well organized. I also saw that you have a decibel meter to measure the sound, which is really cool to me."
"I think that the sound that you picked for the wrong key is really funny,and the one that you picked for the right key is really amazing, I was so surprised when I heard it, so I'm really enjoy using it."
"I think you did a good jobs, and also picked a really awesome music. The most impressive thing in your project is a decibel meter to measure the sound."
"I liked the samples used. Trying to remember where the sample for the ""good key"" is from. Sounds familiar."
