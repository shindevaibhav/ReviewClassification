I think if you expanded on what you wanted your music playing device would do or even look/ sound like it would have stretched your thinking a bit more.
"If I was your partner Id suggest adding visuals to make it more of an installation. I am not much of a sound girl so I would like to come up with some visuals to add to your abstract music piece. Do the different sounds have to by programmed to keys or can we think of a more interesting way to ""play"". Or are the sounds you play the important part of your project? Is it strictly abstract or can there be a way for the user to express themselves having more control???"
"All three of the questions were answered, but, in my opinion, were a little vague. The answers stated pretty much what they wanted to do, but I didn't read very much thought being put into these answers. All questions are answered clearly, just not in a very detailed manner."
"Using the ideas laid out with creating music using RGB values, I think we could make something that also looks at everyday objects and people to create music in an experimental manner."
"On the first and third questions they had a pretty solid idea, but question two they failed to put really any effort or real thought into. The first idea could be fleshed out better in terms of how the physical presentation would look like as well as why their idea is important and what the goal of it is.
 
 
 
 1. A very simple midi keyboard program for a computer.
 
 2. Another ipod? 
 
 3. A program that reads color and turns it into music."
"A program that uses the keyboard controller they proposed in the first idea, but instead of just playing & recording music, the keys would also play colors that the creator would match up to certain notes or sounds according to their perception of emotion."
Using a laser to initiate sounds while playing a game. Passing data via laser doesnt seem plausible to me.
"There are definitely three separate ideas proposed, but all based around similar technology: lasers. All seem like pretty solid ideas; one being to make a simple environment where laser are pointed at targets to create musical tones, another using laser signals to beam data between devices, and the last using lasers for a target practice type game."
"The first and third ideas seem most plausible. Combining the two, we could make certain noises when different targets are hit. Expanding on just the third idea, we could make a few different environments for the target simulator. Maybe something as simple as the silhouette targets police use in a shooting range, or as complex as a city street/alley/etc."
I think that the video game idea using lasers is possible to accomplish this semester. But maybe using a wii remote would work better than using the kinect since there may not be too much motion.
"The glove project is the most interesting project. It is hard to track person's hand moving, I know. But you can develop the idea further. For example, if you can use the glove to remote manipulate some objects. Or even an idea, but I think the introduction video will be awesome."
"Overall, I believe this person put a decent amount of thought into the ideas. Each idea is written vividly and thoroughly. 
 
 The first idea is basically to create a device that generates midi sounds with an arduino and some buttons/knobs. 
 
 The second idea is basically creating remote control soldiers for the use of the army, essentially making military deaths a thing of the past.
 
 The third idea is to create a glove that works with the oculus rift to track hand movements to be translated into the virtual world within the oculus rift."
"Honestly, anything I can think of has already been done. My initial thought was to combine 1 & 3, to make a glove that works like a midi controller. However, that was basically done recently by Imogen Heap. Another idea would be to combine the soldier drone suit and the game controller. Just having a full-body controller for VR systems, but that would take more than a semester."
"The virtual reality glove would require a lot of fine-tuning in order to make it complete, and although I don't have much experience with working on hardware, I would be able to work on the software end of the project. Rather than trying to replicate the exact feelings of the player moving their hand, I would shift towards a more game-oriented end goal by programming the glove to sense the user's reason for using their hand then acting accordingly (for example, a grasping hand motion would be registered as the user trying to grab something, which would then cause the user's avatar in the virtual world to grab something). This is more game-focused than the original idea, though it would be the same project overall."
"The answers displayed here show that a lot of thought was put into these questions. Everything was answered clearly and concisely, with lots of detail and creativity."
"I'd love to work with the arduino live music control. One thing we could add would be programable visuals with the live music, in order to enhance the live experience. This could be with projection mapping, color recognition, or even animations."
"I'd shift this student's third idea away from live concerts and more towards an app that could simulate what an actual concert might be like given some music, wherever they may be. It would consist of the same features and would focus more on the app's software than interacting with music that is currently playing, allowing users to play a song and change various settings to make it sound as if it was being played live. I would feel that it would be more feasible and more about the technical efforts than interacting with musicians themselves."
"I would say that ideas 2 and 3 are definitely more focused with and objective, however though I am impressed with idea 1, it explains more of what your skills are rather than an actual particular project such as ""make a video that does X"" or ""compose a song around X ideas"". I got confused at the beginning of 1 because you state that you could build a website but then later make note that you do not have much programming experience, so I am assuming this would be done by some other means like a template website designer and not actually using HTML and CSS."
"Overall I felt that the student made a good effort to explain their ideas. 
 
 
 
 1. An unspecified rough app or computer program. 
 
 
 
 2. A series of sensors in bikes and/ or cars that alert drivers/ cyclists to potential collisions. 
 
 
 
 3. An app that the city/ police can use to see where cyclist have had accidents or poor experiences so that changes can be made to prevent future accidents."
"This student is looking to create a prototype of an interface that is beneficial to those who like to ride their bicycles on the road and care about their safety. I think they did clearly propose their motivations and thoughts, being concerned with improving public cycling collisions and allowing some sort of warning system."
"This student definitely went in depth and was really detailed about what they would do in these situations. I honestly believe they could get a lot done in a week from the first question, do something really awesome and a lot of good from the second question, and continue their project on and make it better in the third answer."
"The first, week-long project would simply be an outline for a longer-term project.
 
 The second idea is to develop some form of cerebral interface for virtual reality games.
 
 The third idea is to create an AI that learns from it's mistakes."
"1) A quick board/video game
 
 2) NCVR - Virtual Reality that is truly immersive (utilizing all senses)
 
 3) Creating an AI
 
 
 
 It seems like they really put some thought into it, as it all seems to build upon each other. However, the semester idea seems perhaps too ambitious."
"It might be interesting to do sort of an augmented reality space - a physical landscape used in a ""game"" in which a user completes tasks/challenges with the aid of things like visual displays (a la Google Glass) and actuator gloves."
"He/she has ideas about the game design are related human body and nervous system. His/her plans and ideas are related each other. Also, he/she has rough design concept and I think he/she has potential energy to develop and realize the system. That is not perfect yet, but it would be great project under his/her plans during this collaboration project. Also, his/her NCVR project is not far away from today."
Yes they made a effort with their three ideas being. 1. To build a moto-Bike of some sort similar to a moped. 2. To create a water powered system to create energy. 3. To make an interactive environment with lasers and such.
I think they thought about what they wanted to do. It was what seemed to be as much elaboration as needed for this type of assignment. It seemed like everything was more or less just an idea and there was nothing that had really been thought of.
1. Put a motor on the bike. 2. Find some thing can save water or other resources. 3. Using laser technology into projection mapping.
"They actually seem to emit a sense of having a clear idea on their heads that may just be much easier to describe with pictures rather than words. i can see their vision, but not much of the whole concept yet."
"Okay:
 
 
 
 I picture this proposition of creating some sort of ""photon graffiti"" that would SOMEHOW work by vandalizing anything you want in an extremely removable way. Maybe something that could last for a few hours only or who knows.
 
 
 
 Maybe I am thinking way too outside the box, let's try again:
 
 
 
 A projector that is kept on for scribbling anything on your wall for reminders and what not, using ""light pens"", and not worry about having a corkboard or whiteboard for everything you wanna plan. Go caveman on it and scribble freely in the room without making an actual mess.
 
 
 
 These sci-fi movies sometimes have these fancy holograms to make a visual explanation of their plans and we could develop something similar, except much more versatile and less impossible like holograms that pop out of thin air."
"Although they made attempts and I think their ideas were in the right direction because the person wanted to tackle larger problems; however, they didn't propose workable ideas."
"Idea 1: It is not really a full idea, but rather a general 'first steps to a larger project' outline.
 
 Idea 2: The idea is to assemble a team that can work to find a way to make a college education free for everyone, or to buy everyone a sports car should this team prove unsuccessful.
 
 Idea3: This is not really a full idea either, but it builds on the idea of assembling a team presented in Idea 2.
 
 
 
 While the specifics of the process this student would like use when starting to work on something are fleshed-out a bit, the specifics of what this student would like to do are only expressed in the Second idea concerning free college education. So it is a little vague."
"Ideas 1 and 3 do not have a definitive project idea and are more so how far along one could develop the stages of making an idea in that time, whereas 2 the idea is to find a way to make education free to individuals. In idea one the student states that they could outline and blueprint some rough ideas of what a final project may do, and plan the next stages to get there. In idea 3 the student states that they would recruit a team of individuals to develop a more cohesive project."
"I believe that the student made a sincere effort into their answers for ideas 1 and 2, and to a lesser extent idea 3. Idea 2 could have used some more clarification as I am not wholly sure what these group games are, while idea three could use some expanding upon.
 
 
 
 Their one week idea was to create a mini-game that tested the end users reaction time and post their ""score"" on an internet serve, thus allowing players to rank their times.If they were given no time or money limit they would want to construct a world fitness center that both explores the concept of group games that promote healthy fitness as well as having machines/other equipment that help the users stay fit. They are willing to offer prize incentives for working overtime. For their semester goal they wish they wish to be more involved in their gaming company and create several more games for a college student audience that help them with their class studies."
"Idea 1: a simple game that measures reaction time to different situations, and shows these times against the times of others.
 
 Idea 2: A collection of games that promote exercise and fitness, some of which incorporate gym equipment, all of which are part of a larger businesslike organization.
 
 Idea 3: Expanding an already established gaming company that focuses on college course material.
 
 
 
 This student has clearly-proposed three ideas and has touched on the details and motivations for them."
"My ideas involve animation, and this student's ideas involve gaming (specifically concerning fitness and foundation building for classes).
 
 
 
 So a joint project would probably take the form of a video game. I have done 3D art for video games, and any game that incorporated character animation (as so many do) would align with my main interest in animation."
"The ideas here are fairly well-thought-out. None of these ideas are very detailed, but at this point, they have enough information that can see the thought put into the ideas."
"I think I would want to scale down the second idea. Instead of changing the outside of a building, we could make a projection that alters image based on interaction of viewers in front of a sensor such as a kinect."
"There is a coherent project idea in each answer. 
 
 
 
 1. A set of hand painted images than could be formatted into booklets for special occasions. 
 
 
 
 2. An interactive building facade on a skyscraper that changed base don the people in it or by it that highlighted them in some way. 
 
 
 
 3. A business that creates games that are both educational and entertaining."
"Working on a small game or proof of concept that taught geologic principles through exploration of underground tunnels and caves would be a potential idea. The idea for this is to have students discover different types of rock and geological processes while actually down in the depths of the earth, showing why this information si interesting firsthand."
"I think the student has interesting ideas regarding the exploratory questions of this assignment, but needs to be more specific about their ideas in question 2 and 3. How would the display make the skyscraper building ""less standard""? What are the games that can be played outside of the classroom? 
 
 
 
 His/her three ideas are to create a wedding book of painted stock images, an interactive display of digital arts at the side of a skyscraper, and an educational video games based on a business idea."
The three ideas can be combined into one. I am thinking of displaying the wedding book's pictures at the side of the Skyscraper where people passing by can interact with the pictures with their hand movements as though they are playing video games.
"The first idea was a scanable storybook program, that simplifies and makes creating photo albums easy and simple. The second was to create a building that would react to people in, around, and people looking at the building, interacting visually with all of them. The third idea is video game education program, working inside schools and possibly outside. 
 
 
 
 The ideas were sincere but the last idea really could have been explained a bit more, all ideas are good. Especially the building idea, it really makes me wish that existed in a large scale."
"Well working within the education game, you could possible extend the controller of the program into physical space. Using arduino to create physical controllers would be simple and could create a new realm for the game to be played in."
"Idea one is to design a game, non-functional, but with the architecture in place. Idea two is to essentially make their own video game development company and eventually build the best game possible. Lastly, idea 3 is to make a small exploration driven game, examples are stated but I have no experience with any of them to know what they may be."
"You know what you want to do so the stretching your thinking can be done in the context of your video game. since we are talking about making the world a better place does the game teach the user, inform them, anything other then just entertaining them?"
1. A first person shooter game. 2. He would like to do many games to gain experiences. Then he will use his experience to do a big game which has important topics to the society. 3.A small exploration driving game.
"As the author mentions, he is a game level designer. So I am interesting in his game level design. It would be fun to explore the key of each level in order to reach the next level. But I have no idea about how to do that. Hope to see your game!"
I think that the student displayed a nicely planned out set of steps that would allow the project to flourished.
"If I was to work with this student, then I would extend the app to maybe act more like a artificial intelligence machine to interact with its users."
They seemed to make a sincere effort and propose three things. The first being to just simply plan ahead as much as possible. The second was to create a non profit company organization that hires law enforcement that uses patrol devices. The third is to showcase a demo of the idea with a mobile app.
"I think this student really thought through what they could do with the time and resources with a project, and came up with some really interesting ideas."
"I'm not sure if the first one is something I would work on with this student, just because I like to create things that are used and help people. Although it's a cool idea, I'm not sure that music or sounds playing when you open the door or touch the handle are something that I would find interesting enough to help on. 
 
 
 
 However, I would definitely be able to help with the other two ideas. I think the mapping is a great idea, especially in a very cultural way. You would be able to discover things with the mapping that you wouldn't normally be able to unless you took a trip all the way there which takes time and money. 
 
 
 
 I would also be able to work on the last one, also possibly working on a fun animation PSA to spread across the country and the world and hopefully be able to get more individuals involved in saving the Earth's resources."
"Only two ideas were provided, but I did feel the classmate gave adequate descriptions of their ideas. 
 
 
 
 1.A project that involves touch and sound. When individuals touched a door handle, this action would trigger different sounds. 
 
 2.Large scale projection mapping. The project might involve projecting related historical videos on large historical monuments. The point of this project would be to give tourist the opportunity to learn about history when visiting historical sites.
 
 3.Classmate would like to work on a project that helps people."
The projection mapping project is of the most interest to me. I believe this project would be best accomplished by developing a large scale projector. I like the idea of helping to teach the general public about history in a new and exciting way.
"There is definitely some vague writing on the third idea - saying ""I don't know,"" but maybe doing some game - but the other two ideas - interactive touch sensors to trigger sound, and projection mapping onto landmarks - are less vague, but not all that original. There are plenty of videos on YouTube with people projection mapping onto various buildings, and plenty of things (including childrens' toys) use touch sensors to make noises."
"Were I to work with this student, I would prefer to do something with the projection mapping. Obviously in the classroom/showcase setting we wouldn't be able to project onto anything like the great wall, but we could use the same idea on a smaller scale."
"If I was to work with this student, then I would suggest that we extend on the idea of making a arduino program that can sense the temperature and gives some sort of results."
"This person gives a pretty clear idea of what he wants to create, but fails to explain the purpose of creating it. What would set it apart? Why make something like this? Sometimes people don't know about a certain movie so how would you then explain your idea to them?
 
 
 
 1. colored light programmed by arduino
 
 2. Virtual Reality gaming
 
 3. Motion Capture rc car"
"I would have this student's knowledge of Arduino assist me in getting together a system that plays a colored light when a person presses a button, but then also takes a picture of that person at that same time; thus creating a ""selfie"" filter that is created instantly like a photobooth. Another use for it is we could do long exposure photos, and the user could press certain lights to light the picture before drawing with their LED."
"I think the student made an effort with their ideas, although they could use more information as to what tools they would want to try and use. For example, in his third idea, it is unclear as to what softwares or hardware would be needed in order to control the car or plane.
 
 
 
 Reiteration of ideas:
 
 Idea 1 - Using arduino, make an interactive system with 3 buttons that change colors.
 
 Idea 2 - Submerge a user into a virtual reality world.
 
 Idea 3 - Control RC car or plane with hand movements."
"I had a bit of difficulty understanding the third idea, but overall I felt that Tammy explained her ideas well. 
 
 
 
 1.In a week, Tammy would brainstorm, collect data, create a virtual and a paper prototype, and gather information from users and experts regarding her project. 
 
 2.Tammy would create a therapy program for children with special needs. She would use her resources to hire experts in related fields, and try to create the best program possible. 
 
 3.Tammy would create a mechanism that would record neurological feedback, and heart rate, when a user is exposed to certain stimuli."
"If me and this student were assigned to work on a project I think that both of us would have to come to a compromise since I am not skilled in the area that the student is speaking of doing a project on. I believe that the second idea that the student spoke on is a project that we could actually work on together, and we could also combine aspects of the first and third idea together to make a really cool project."
"It seems that this student detailed how their proposed project for the semester would look in a week, a semester, and in an unspecific amount of time with a billion dollars, rather than proposing three different ideas. The idea seems to be to make hardware, like a robot, that mimics the way the human body looks and works, with the end goal of using it to study the form of the body. The purpose of studying the form is not clear, though with the types of things this student wishes to do, it appears to be useful for general knowledge of the body for anyone that may want to know, whether artistic or health-related."
"This seems rather hardware-focused for the semester, while my skills focus on software. I'd be able to make it into more of an active, functional robot, perhaps as a way to simulate how the human body would move and react to various factors."
"Since it's one idea this is easy! For a semester, to have us actually work on, we would definitely need some scaling back. As far as a sort of machine to measure brain waves, I have no idea how to use it, or where to get one. This poses a big problem for us. As far as something for the heart, this might be a little difficult too. I'm not sure if you want an actual heart sensor, and what you need it for. They do have pulse sensors (http://goo.gl/7kFhfY) that you can use to measure heart rate, and are used by putting the sensor at either your fingertip or your earlobe. The people that created the sensor have a newer version of their product, which may be a better source of a pulse. 
 
 
 
 With all this, I'm not sure what you would want to accomplish. I'm not an expert on psychological aspects, so I'm not sure what would come out of having these strapped to a person, especially just for the heart sensor. You can tell when someone maybe is scared or something, but as far as getting that data and making something out of it, I have no idea. Especially because you want something that helps special needs children get better treatment I guess?"
"I dont really know what the mobile mouse case is but going to Dubai sounds like fun, I had a blast last time I was there."
"It sounds as if you have one solid idea. Could you elaborate a little more on it? You call it your mobile mouse case, so what exactly makes it specialized?"
"I'm pretty sure I couldn't contribute very much. By the sound of it, this student has a pretty good grasp on what they plan on doing. However if they were accepting help I might be able to help craft the project. I spent a year in industrial design crafting prototypes and I might be able to lend a hand in the actual making of this product."
"I really liked the idea 2. We would definitely have to modify it, but I think that within our own phoenix community there are a lot of dichotomies physical appearances."
"Their ideas are far too vague, I can't really start to picture what they had in their mind from this limited explanation. I am not too sure they too this assignment with the utmost sincerity. That being said, the general idea of what they wish to accomplish is quite clear due to its concentration of words. However, many questions about their ideas exist. Why do we need a new internet infrastructure? What type of game/app do you want to develop? What type of installation do you wish to build, and with what tools?
 
 
 
 Their ideas: 
 
 
 
 One Week: A small digital installation that has physical elements to it.
 
 
 
 Unlimited Time and Money: To create a new infrastructure for the internet that allows for everyone to be connected using solar/kinetic power as its power source.
 
 
 
 Realistic Semester: To create an interactive mobile game."
"I think the student put in effort but the ideas are still very vague for idea 2 and 3.
 
 
 
 Idea 1 - The idea mentioned painting the body of his motorcycle.
 
 
 
 Idea 2 - The idea mentioned creating a project that would make people more physically active. How would you go about promoting that? What motive would people have to jog instead of drive somewhere (especially when your destination is very far away)?
 
 
 
 Idea 3 - The idea mentioned creating a social media app for motorcycle riders. Need more information on what this app does, what software/programming language you are using, etc."
"Combining these ideas is somewhat tricky, since they seem to conflict with one another. On one side, you are trying to persuade people to be more physically active, but on the other side, there seems to be a big interest in motorcycling. If I had to extend on one of your ideas though, I'd maybe incorporate features to your social media app that not only talk about motorcycles, but also inform the public about being more physically active."
"I mentioned designing an Arcology when referencing your second idea (making people more active). Maybe we could work that into your project this semester. Obviously you could not make such a structure in a semester, however maybe you could draw up some blueprints for it. You could design it so that people would not have to use cars to get anywhere with everywhere being accessible by walking or elevators. You could look up how to make a self sufficient Arcology and try to incorporate that into your blueprints, was well as where you would place emergency services, housing, commercial, and schools."
"I think that you have some good ideas. I really liked the first idea that you came up with it sounds as if you have put some thought into it. As for your second idea, would it be possible to empower these communities with a simplified version of your plan. When I think of the struggles that these communities have to deal with, my first notion is not that they are in need of jobs. Couldn't you help provide these communities with the means of acquiring power without setting up a full on power plant? Is there a cheaper, more dispensable means of creating a power generating device for these communities? Much like the paper water filter book, could you develop something that could provide usable energy at a low cost?"
"The three ideas were creating a short film that can inspire and also intrigue an audience, help make the world a better/happier place without the use a pharmaceutical drugs, and to learn more of the side of engineering and development. Some of the answers were pretty vague, like what type of film do you think would be inspirational, what type of audience or culture would you like to base it off of or target the film to? What do YOU think can make the world happier? Just try to expand more on these ideas and it would help."
"Your film idea is kind of vague. Inspirational can be so many things to so many people, you might want to focus on a specific topic over everything else. For your second idea, a ton of research would need to be made. You said you'd like to make the world happy with out the use of pharmaceutical drugs which makes me think you're also trying to have something that will help fight depression, not just boredom or sadness. A thing to keep in mind is that the brain holds onto more negative thoughts than positive. The third idea almost sounds like you'd like to know more about developing a program? I'm not really sure what you'd want to accomplish, but you should look for a group that is well rounded, and pay attention to your developers."
"I like the idea about making people happy and I know there is someone else who would like to do something similar to that in this class. What I think I would do first with this idea is to set a specific group (like college students around campus) and just go out and start interviewing. If you have a set list of questions its easy to just go up to someone and ask for some input. The good thing about starting on campus is that there are so many students from all different backgrounds, you'll start to get that wide variety of research you're looking for."
"I really would love to go off of the whole making people happy thing, but again, emotions are very subjective. Unless we actually had something that is proven to effectively make different people happy each time they use this product, it wouldn't work well. I mean, we could take a survey of everyone in DC and ask them what they think is funny, or what makes them happy, and you can make a short film on it?"
"So the second idea is definitely not in reach for a semester. You could combine the first and third ideas though. Obviously a short film would have some sort of sound, but maybe you could make a short film documenting how much you learn about music?"
"It was little hard to imagine what project would be. However, I agree with a week would be short week to develop a project. Also, some project could not make with unlimited fund and short time. I think you are good visualist and if you collaborate with other designers such as sound, media installation, and animator, it would be great project during this semester. Moreover, you can make plant to connect these three ideas that visual, clean water or self driving system, and music stuff. These are would be great project to interective each system to make human life better."
"The student said they could make some sort of interactive installation, something robotic, or a matrix made of LEDs for the first idea. For the second idea, the student said that instead of one huge project, they would would work on making what we have easier to make and at cheaper costs. This way, more people could make things to solve more problems. For the third idea, I kind of don't understand it, but that's totally on me because it seems like they know what they are talking about. I'm just not sure the final outcome."
"The person has a broad range of interests, but I feel that the first two responses are really vague since they talk about what kind of projects they want to work on rather than what projects. Also, what they specified in the first question may be something that would be more than they can handle in one week.
 
 
 
 The third idea is much clearer as they explain their project and its structure and functions. 
 
 
 
 Their three ideas are some project that deals with electrical devices, a cheap hardware to help people, and a mechanical display that moves in fluid-like motion."
"The third idea has a lot to work with, so I would like to extend that into a large art piece that can be placed at a water show or a museum of machines. I think it would be interesting to see the inner working, like cables and light connections, to give the display some flair too."
"I know nothing about music and theater, but maybe with my sculpture skills we could design a set. Although the set would be here in Tempe, it could reference South Korean theater and draw attention to the South Korean theater community both here and abroad."
"I found this classmates ideas interesting, but had difficulty understanding the details, and how their ideas would be accomplished. 
 
 
 
 1. In a week, this classmate would brainstorm and ask key questions about their project. They are most interested in working on a project that connects sound and visuals. 
 
 2. This classmate would like to create an infinite theatre, with an interactive component. The theatre would involve state of the art equipment and take up an unlimited amount of space. 
 
 3. In a semester, this classmate would create an interactive performance scene."
"If I were to work with this classmate I would be most interested in working with him to create an infinite theatre. This idea sounded interesting, but I couldnt quite understand the details or picture the end result. I think this project would involve a great deal of technological and artistic components, but I would need to have a better understanding of the project to know what was needed to physically accomplish it."
"Perhaps a more augmented graphic novel, with thick ""pages"" for sensors and actuators, so we could provide sound effects (using tiny speakers) and some motion (motors under paper). Like the pop-up book of the future."
I can see where this student was heading. So there ideas were thoughtful but just not expressed deeply through the assignment but it is obvious they have passion for this project.
3D animation and psychology. Maybe a project that uses animation to help some sort of psychological disorder?
I would collaborate with this student to create real stimulating sound for the virtual world idea. One of the most important parts of our experience and reality is the 5 senses. I would want to make sure the sound design is perfectly matched to how it is in reality.
"The larger proposed idea is the creation of an entire virtual world and simulator that would allow for the user to transport themselves anywhere. The second idea is making a video game that centers around AI making it seem as if the computer's AI could be a human. The second idea is basically a smaller version of the first, larger idea."
"I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to offer you much assistance with your project. Although I have some experience developing games and programming, I have a very limited knowledge on the subject. However if you needed somebody to help craft something or to help develop character designs, I could be the man for the job."
"The first idea is to do some programming for a video game.
 
 The second idea is to create a very high end video game.
 
 The third idea is to create a less high end video game than in idea 2."
We could make a videogame.
If me and this student were assigned to collaborate together for the semester I would like to explore the possibilities of the students' last idea that involved a new way of playing video games with the cube that involves the first idea and some elements of the second idea.
"It is very apparent that this person to the time and effort to sincerely answer all three idea questions. They go into detail on what they exactly want to accomplish as well as what tools they would like to use for their project. I could very easily get a picture in my head for each of their three concepts and thus believe they explained their points clearly and concisely.
 
 
 
 Their ideas: 
 
 
 
 One Week: They wish to using projection mapping for either an art gallery or to show off their own line of clothing. They would use Max msp to facilitate the projection mapping and would plan on using video.
 
 
 
 Unlimited Time and Money: The wish to create a digital environment projection mapped into a room that children in hospitals and explore and play with using their hands or feet instead of controllers.
 
 
 
 Realistic Semester: A cube that would not allow the transgression of video game screen looking to cheat when planing with friends. This cube will have each player's perspective projection mapped on a different face making nigh impossible to catch a glimpse of what your friend in doing."
"This person has a major interest in projection mapping and interactive environments, this could be relatively easy to work with the appropriate direction and resource management. Even if there is an inclusion of a clothing brand, the proposals are concise and clear."
"You have a good grasp on what you'd like to do. As long as you're comfortable with projection mapping I believe that all of your ideas will work. I'm not exactly sure what you would do with the art gallery, but if you've made some pieces of you're own you could make them pop using the projection. I also like that you're thinking of working with kids. You can do a lot with the idea of making an interactive environment around them, and even make it so that they can visit different places around the world from their own bed. The only thing I'm concerned about with the xbox is the split screen projection mapping. You might have to work with 2 different projectors."
I'd want to work more with your clothing brand idea. If you have some physical objects that people could model you could take video of that and then build a runway like stage to make an infinite runway. Along it you could use projection mapping on some mannequins along the way so that people can look at what you have.
"The student's first idea is to carve a unique wolf sculpture, idea two is vague but has an endgame of creating an emotionally evocative space for individuals, and lastly idea 3 is to create an installation."
"I do not think that I could help out with project 1 in much of a way as I do not have any carving experience, but possibly I could assist in the formation of ideas 2 or 3. The ideation seems pretty confident with project three so I think I could only assist in the actual physical construction of the installation, it doesn't seem like there would be much software involved. In idea 3 I could possibly help in the ideation process and define a solid idea of what the implemented project actually will be."
I honestly don't know what I'd have to offer this student as far as her project goes. She seems to have her concepts and procedures and work steps pretty thoroughly planned out and there's not much of a visually element that would make my drawing skills necessary.
They made a sincere effort and proposed three ideas. The first idea was to carve a hyper realistic figure of a wolf. The second was to create some sort of environment that creates something eco-friendly. The third was to create a frame to a viewer could see the light in some creative way.
"This student can definitely go different ways into what type of project he or she wants to do. However, I think that maybe he or she should stick to some sort of project that has to do with geometry or coding or both."
"If I was to work with this student, then I would suggest focusing on a geometry oriented project."
"The person has definitely thought about it, and although the second idea doesn't have an exact project, the idea is there. 
 
 The first idea is to make a sculpture. 
 
 The second idea is to somehow create a way to emotionally connect with other people using technology of some sort. 
 
 The third idea is to create an installation that in short, involves a light and it delivers a message about personal serenity."
"Time travel has always been an interest of mine. That being said, and Alternate Timeline Transportation Device sounds pretty cool. Paradoxes are no fun, so this seems like a much more safe alternative."
"I'm not sure exactly what we could work on, but it seems like we both have similar interests based on the responses (Twitch, gaming, time travel) so the ideas would definitely be alike."
"The interactive system featuring the mermaid and the inverse of Twitch Plays Pokemon seem like two appealing ideas that can be blended. I am thinking that the project could be an installation of tv and projector such that a video game console is hooked up to a tv, which has a projection mapping of a mermaid on the screen. Whatever button a user presses on their console, the button can affect the mermaid's behaviors."
The first idea was linking multiple consoles together to be able to play multiple video games from one console. The second idea is to develop an alternate timeline device that would allow users to experience their lives if they made different decisions. The third idea is to develop a virtual mermaid tank in which the mermaid would react dynamically to the environment.
I think we could take the last one and turn it into a project this semester. The equipment is already easily available and it wouldn't be much of a stretch to bring this project to life with the correct sensors and programming.
"The last idea seemed the most doable I would try and focus on scope of the project though.
 
 Would it be life size or smaller?
 
 How would it work in a crowded room?
 
 How many reactions would the mermaid have?"
"All three responses are good ideas, even if idea #2 is currently technologically infeasible. 
 
 
 
 1. A setup that allows a player to play 5 simple games at once as an interesting experience. 
 
 
 
 2. A device that allows users to jump between timelines/ dimensions to try out different actions or choices in life. 
 
 
 
 3. A tank with a projection mapped mermaid inside that reacted to people in a room."
"I think that the mermaid tank idea is really interesting, though it would likely be rather difficult. Making a prototype of this however could be feasible in a semester or two, where a smaller or simpler object or the skeleton of the mermaid model could be mapped into a special fish tank."
"The ideas are definitely clear as they are and feel well thought-out. The first idea is a stand to hold various electronic devices and chargers on a stand, specifically next to a bed. The second idea is a low-cost wearable device that generates energy through being outdoors or exercising, potentially solving both energy and health problems through motivating people to exercise to charge their electronic devices. The third idea is a game in which the student does most of the artistic work (art, models, environments, etc), and although the exact design of the game is not clear, it appears the student would prefer to work on a shooter of some sort."
"I like the idea of a hat or shirt that gathers electricity and i would want to branch off more on that, more because I'm not really sure about you're game idea, but I'd also like to learn more about it. As for the clothing, I think a big thing is focusing on the overall design of the clothing, to make sure that people would wear them. I also think development of a solar battery would need to go into the shits/hats/pants as well. Things to consider is if they need to be connected to the shirt at all times, how heavy they would be, and if the article are machine washable."
"I would try to help this student get more specific on there goals.
 
 What is the end result?
 
 How would you want people to feel?
 
 What would the sculpture be or do?"
I think it would be feasible to build something like an interactive sculpture using sensors and computers to do the calculations and alter the sculpture.
"The student put in a lot of time and effort into his/her ideas. Although these ideas are very detailed with what the student wants accomplished in the end, ideas 2 and 3 need more information as to what exactly Digital Culture students would be doing during the semester/year to apply their skills, aka, the ""engage and make it fun"" and ""find a way to expand"" needs work. I do understand the overall goal but this needs more explanation as to what a group of 4 students would be doing exactly.
 
 
 
 Reiteration of ideas:
 
 Idea 1 - Complete composition of two songs for cinematic, game, or advertisement.
 
 Idea 2 - Create campus ministries in all of the universities in America to establish relationships with the campus and business in the respective state.
 
 Idea 3 - Build partnerships with organizations and expand The Respect Movement to other campuses."
"Since your first idea seems to show an interest in creating music, I think you could tie this in with ideas 2 and 3. As an example, use the semester to create a song, maybe even a music video, to promote ideas 2 and 3. This music video could use projectors, cameras, and software that the digital culture has available to students."
I would be interested in seeing how far this project would go. I want to see the process of this project campaign and how it is develop. The ministry service is an project that look like it would grow by time not so sure about how big but I would like to contribute someway to see that project grows.
"The person has definitely thought of what they wanted to do. Although, I'm honestly not sure how exactly it would tie into digital culture. I do see potential in it though. Maybe some more thought about what digital culture is about, then try and make something that ties directly to that idea.
 
 The first idea is to basically make a song for someone.
 
 The second idea is to create an organization kinda like the Newman Center but better.
 
 The third idea is to become more connected with other campuses to create a more equal culture."
"I think that maybe we could tie in the songs with individuals and their need for equality. I guess what I am saying is that we could make an installation that scans someones face, then according to their structure or facial expression, it would create a song for that person."
"Not sure if the second idea is really for the billion dollars if not simply use $100 and get away with $999'999,900 at hand, but hey, honestly I would like some of that cheddar too. But I digress:
 
 
 
 This person has obvious interests in using projection mapping as a central thematic and makes absolute sense. Except, again, for the eyebrow-raising budget of a billion dollars for a simple project like that."
"I am intrigued by the project on the third bullet, only thing that keeps me wondering how well it would work is just the movement part because part of the illusion of space involvements like this is kinesthesic activity.
 
 
 
 SO!
 
 
 
 Introducing Virtuix Omni: a treadmill specifically designed of VR movement. http://www.virtuix.com/
 
 
 
 Perhaps using this could help with the production, albeit I am not sure if it would work way much better using Oculus Rift as well, which might just ruin the point of creating a projected environment outside.
 
 
 
 But I digress, I can sense something brewing."
"I would like to go with the immersive environment animation because it coordinates well with my idea of make an immersive environment for sick children in a Child's Hospital. I feel if we made an animation sequence that can give the children a sense of POV of the character on their journey, that could greatly be helpful for them. Since most of the children do not have access to such adventures, we could make an immersive environment that can give them a sense of adventure. Also incorporate the clothing onto the child so say the child is a knight on a quest, the immersive environment would be projected onto the surrounded and a knight's outfit or armor can be projected onto the clothing of the child to really give them the POV of the character."
"These projects seem to be well thought out considering the constraints.
 
 The first is for a simple projection mapping on an object.
 
 The second is for a wearable system that communicates with projector some how to trigger different displays.
 
 The last is for a animation that gives the viewer two different perspectives, I think this would be interesting but might be complicated."
I would help this artist to consider the time involved in animating because they would be making two animations which is going to eat up some time especially if they want to work in 3D. I would also hope they had some ideas on what the character looked like or the environment they character would be in because I would want to get started on the animations as soon as possible.
"The student I believe did give a sincere and to the point answer with their ideas, the student also clearly proposed three things. The first idea that the student spoke of was mapping animations on to objects and using the object's shape as a way of increasing the visual effects of the animations. The second idea was mapping and tracking clothing on individuals and using it for artistic purposes. The last idea was creating a projection that allows the user to step inside the object being projected on and view the shots from the characters point of view."
"I honestly don't feel like I know enough about the type of thing being proposed, so I have no idea how I would contribute. Although I do think 2 & 3 are worthy of the time and effort."
1. The student said he/she will prepare enough before doing a project. 2. Finding a way to clean water. Like to clean the rain water. 3. To build prototypes about collect water from the atmosphere.
The ideas are great. The steps of making a one-week project are organized. But they are too general so I can't develop more ideas base on that.
"The student put in effort into their ideas but I think more details are needed, as well as possible tools/skills that would be required. In idea 2, I love the idea, but how would you incorporate the solar energy part with this clean water process? In idea 3, I think more information is needed as to what materials/tools/skills would possibly be required for a group of students to create possible prototypes.
 
 
 
 Reiteration of ideas:
 
 Idea 1 - Creation of the outline, draft, visual presentation, write up, and materials required for a possible project.
 
 Idea 2 - Provide clean water to people, and also an air transport system to collect rain water, purify it, and then distribute it, by using solar energy.
 
 Idea 3 - Create prototypes of idea 2 and distribute it with biodegradable containers."
"Your ideas reminded me of the LifeStraw (http://www.buylifestraw.com/). This technology allows people around the world to filter contaminated water and allow it to be instantly drinkable through a straw. I think in a semester or two, a group of students could take a LifeStraw, and build on it even more somehow. Maybe use the same technology to where, instead of drinking from a straw, make a fast and easy way to clean and store this water instead for later usage."
I would definitely partner up on this project since it is about a subject that is very important in life and for society to have clean running water is very important.
Idea 1 is to make a stop motion video using action figures. Idea 2 is create an interface that would allow magic cards to become 3D mapped on to the field. Idea 3 is create a portfolio of all the artwork and projects they have created.
This person made a sincere effort and proposed three ideas. The first was to create a stop motion film. The second was to create an interface that scans and 3D prints magic cards. The third was to generate a personal portfolio.
"This entry suggests a website that builds on the great commercial success of JK Rowling's series of books and movies. 
 
 The interaction by the reader with the capability of creating their pathway is enticing for people."
There is a lot of information there. Reddit appears to be an ever expanding source of information. If this is so then it meets the challenge like the blog.
"I'm looking forward to seeing what kind of image you use for this post. Perhaps adding a link to the different types of posts you described (photo-centric, media, text, etc) to give the reader the chance to see how the site works would be helpful?"
"The only thing I can say could use a bit of revising would be that you kept repeating that this book is a compilation of many different people's thoughts. I felt while reading your assignment that you may have repeated this so many times in different ways to fill space and hit the required word counts. If this is true, it's unfortunate because you did a great job on this assignment. I'd omit some of these repetitive phrases in your final draft.
 
 
 
 I also noticed the misspelling of a word in the following sentence: ""What makes this book afuture book is that it doesnt have a single author. It is more like an interactive blog or news feed on an internet social media sight ([SITE]<--change to this spelling) that an actual book."""
"I disagree with you that the future of books will be audiobooks! That's besides the point though and a personal opinion, not a literary critique. In all, I think that you completed this assignment in a purposeful, meaningful manner.
 
 
 
 Perhaps the only critique I have is that maybe you could explain why audiobooks haven't already taken off (it's a media that's been around for quite some time) and expand on the idea of why now is the audiobook's perfect opportunity for a comeback."
"The description falls short, not just in word count, but in its aim to make me want to go out and read this book immediately. Vegan or not, the book should make me want to see what makes it different, how it can be a ""future"" book. I think with a little more explanation, this description could stand out more. Figure out exactly what makes Emily special to the vegan cookbook world. How is she innovative? If it's not just a cookbook, explain why."
"The future factor explanation is very well done. I definitely want to find something like this, as I'm sure most people who enjoy faster processing would. By appealing to the demand of the people, this entry meets the challenge, though it does not offer a way for people to actually find such a book."
"The only thing I think may have been too bold of a statement was when you said that ""film will always be more powerful than text"". I do think that this is a rather subjective statement, as many individuals absolutely become enchanted by and involved in a story when it is on page, because so much is left up to their own imagination. The voice and image of a character, the tone or the character's overall mood, the atmosphere of a building or of a place - and the beauty of written text, at least in fictional stories, is that my perception of a character will never match another's; yet, in a film, a character appears in a very straightforward way, with very little interpretation to the viewer. I think it very much depends on the genre, for one to say that film is more powerful than text. Of course, if a demonstration or learning technique needs to be taught, I can definitely see how film is the way to go. But as for me, I have always been more comfortable with text, as it is easy for me to segment, control, and become enveloped in a story. I guess my critique would be to clarify WHEN film is more powerful than text (as you did) instead of making a general statement that film is ALWAYS better, as many people may not feel this is true. But, other then this, I literally thought that what you wrote was perfect, and I think you posed wonderful points and thoughts - great job!"
"The problem I see with tumblr is that there is no citation, and it is very easy to 'steal' one's work. In the tumblr guidelines, it explicitly states that all content you post is liable to be viewed and re-used by other people. This means someone can re-blog a story or poem you write, and totally trash it, or even edit it themselves. While this is wrong and most individuals wouldn't do this, there is nothing in the tumblr guidelines stating that this is wrong, and tumblr staff cannot be held responsible for if an OP is not given credit for a 'stolen' picture or post. In the future, do you think that there could be an add-on to tumblr that instates a rule or a policy that enables an original poster to always receive credit for their work? If books are moving to be completely online, would not this be necessary on a site like tumblr, if an author wanted to maintain their credibility and their autonomy as the original writer of a work?
 
 Also, another problem I see is that, while there is SO MUCH creativity possible on tumblr, there is not really a place for those who want to become involved in a story to go. If I wanted to read an entire, thousand page book, or even a book series, I would not go on tumblr to do it. It just isn't possible to read so much information on a post. In addition, an author cannot make any profit, or gain any credit other than recognition from writing a book - so if tumblr were to be the future of books, there would be no way for a writer to make a living. Do you think that, in the future, it would be again possible to add on to the site a place for writers of long novels / book series? In this add-on, could it be included that one would have to purchase the author's work before being able to view it and reblog it? This way they are still following the 'tumblr way' and re-blogging work, but they are also honoring an author's time and energy, and cannot simply view it / re-blog without giving at least some form of tribute. This would also make it a lot less possible for someone to 'edit' or 'remove' the OP's part in the post, and it would also still allow for a re-blogger to leave commentary - just, the work wouldn't be free, as books are not free. 
 
 Just a thought! I think the idea of tumblr being the future of books is genius!"
"The only issue I see with your future book idea is that, unless actual books / stories are uploaded by Reddit users, one cant really become involved / pulled in to a fictional world or fantasy land. For many, books are a means of escape, and many book readers want to become involved in the lives of the characters, want to understand them and relate to them, fight for them or fight against them; also, many individuals who read also like the idea of an alternate world existing. For instance, I believe that this is why so many series, like Harry Potter, The Hunger Games, or The Lord of the Rings, were so huge  because there was another universe that readers could disappear into. 
 
 Im not saying that there is no possibility for things like this to exist on Reddit  but your post didnt really give the feeling that users post stories full of characters or alternate worlds. I think that, if you were to include that in the future, entire books and stories will be uploaded onto Reddit, that this is the way books may be read in the future. For instance, if you said something akin to the following,instead of authors publishing books through a publishing company, maybe they will publish their novels through websites such as Reddit, as so many individuals use this website, it would give the sense that books in general are moving in the direction of being completely online through such websites."
"For the most part, the article is solid, even if the ""Description"" section is a bit short.
 
 
 
 My only criticism is that the article seems to only give vague examples as the girth of interactive activities that are available on Pottermore. For example, fan fiction--it's described as a hub for it, what does Pottermore offer that other fanfiction hosting websites do not? How is fanfiction integrated with other areas of the website mentioned, if there is any at all? 
 
 
 
 Also, because Pottermore is an online entity, perhaps it would be helpful to include links?"
"The links are very helpful for anyone who isn't immediately familiar with the app, and the Future Factor of the material is stated very clearly."
"While the links are certainly very helpful, the ""Description"" segment of the article seems to rely on them too much instead of making its own unique statement about what the app is and why the audience should be interested."
"Describing a specific blog, rather than just describing the medium in general, would probably be a better way of showcasing the nature of the blog. However, if the author chooses to continue with simply talking about blogs in general, linking to specific blogs and blogging platforms would be a good way to showcase the diversity mentioned here, rather than just assuring the audience that it exists."
"This is a reasonable example of the direction in which future books are heading, but as the author continues to develop the field guide, it may be interesting for the reader if some of the history of the comic book, particularly as it developed in Japan (Manga, Anime) and Korea (Manhwa) is provided, as well as some thoughts on where all of this may be going as we proceed through this century and beyond. For example, it would seem that this style of reading entertainment -- especially popular to young adults -- is well suited for eventual transformation into 3-D renderings, perhaps even holographic, at some point in the future. In addition, some reference and relevance to our course readings (if possible) would make for a stronger case in point."
"One area in which this entry may fall short (as is the case with my own entry) is that a specific work is not identified. It may be helpful if an example of something like this could be found and then used as a supporting basis for the remainder of the field guide. The implication that the technology of the book and of information in general is moving toward digital is, I think, a valid one, but I for one would like to learn a little more about the specific portions of DNA components that allow us to be able to track historical genetic data and what this technology could afford us in 50 or 100 years. Also, it's always a good idea (as I'm sure you know) if our academic writing can be supported by relevant citations that support our statements and speculations. As your entry thus far is merely a rough first cut (for all of us), this is probably already in your plans as you work toward a final version!"
"Kali's obvious skill at presenting ideas and information -- as her adeptness in articulating opinions in our discussion posts has already been demonstrated -- will be an advantage as she further develops the idea she has proposed in this first draft of her field guide. Hopefully, she will also include some thoughts on how the techniques used by Pessl in ""Night Film"" will evolve as the technologies for interacting with data and ideas (particularly 3-dimensional) progress to the point in which readers feel more like travelers through a parallel universe -- feeling the same sensations experienced by characters in the story -- than outsiders looking in."
It does show how things we did in the past are now improved or changed as a result of technological advances. I clearly understand the point the author is making and the writing is clearly thought-out.
"While the Field Guide explains Reddit very well and enables the user of the guide to navigate the site with ease, its claims that Reddit is the future of books is a bit short sighted. While Reddit may be the future of DIY, self-help and information/resource based books, it will have a hard time treading in the rivers of fiction. Fiction is a huge aspect of books and text still and the Reddit community and the way the site is constructed would struggle in attempting to improve the fiction universe."
The only place I can see that it falls short is that this entry is not actually about a book or something intended to replace a book. It is about a set of applications that essentially act as peripherals to a book. Similar to the way that video game system accessories add capability to the existing system. It would also have been nice to have a some information about the platforms on which these applications are currently available.
"I do not believe this entry falls short. It effectively achieves its goal of describing this ergodic text and what books could look like in the future. I do, however, disagree that this text and those like it show the way forward for the book. I believe they are quite powerful as a novelty, as I believe printed books will become in the future. However, I don't believe they will go further than that and become an industry standard. It would be much more difficult for new authors overall to consistently produce multilayered content as a standard format. It would also get laborious for the reader and the format would no longer be unique. Ergodic literature can range from multilayered storytelling to works of art that use words as their medium. In order to remain as impressive as they are, they rely partially on the fact that the are so different from the traditional book. Additionally, while texts like these seem as though they would have to be produced as a physical book, that is not necessarily true either. A good example would be ""S."", by J.J. Abrams and Doug Dorst, as it is an ergodic text that is also available as an ebook and an audiobook."
"The only suggestion I might have is to focus a bit more on what makes this story special and different from anything we've ever read before, rather than on being so descriptive about the characters or parts of the story. I definitely do want to hear a little about the story line, but feel there is a little bit too much of it here. I want to learn about the characters' reasons for doing things by reading the web comic itself, rather than from a summary. But overall I think this entry makes an excellent case for ""Annarasumanara"" as a futuristic book!"
"Some quick grammar edits I noticed:
 
 Film is powerful, and ""showing"" something to a learner is much more relatable that ""explaining"" something to a learner. -- that needs to be than.
 
 Babies cry when their hungry or uncomfortable and are not capable of fending for themselves. --their needs to be they are or they're.
 
 
 
 ""Film will always be more powerful than text."" This is a huge statement, and I don't think this one film or field guide backs up this statement. Your paragraph after this begins to argue that watching something on a page would be somehow better than reading words on a page, but you don't explain why. Probably I got bristled by this just because I'm a huge reader--for me, text will always be more powerful than film. But I think it might be easier to stick to this specific film, and say why this film is more powerful as a movie than it would be in book form. It is so much easier to prove a smaller point than a larger one, and the length limits for this assignment were so limited the space is really restricted to make a larger point.
 
 
 
 Also, I love your idea of a future book, in the third part, but the instructions read to describe what makes this specific item a future book. So again, I would maybe draw back to the movie Babies and talk a bit more about what the future factor of this film is. I think you could even move the last paragraph of your summary down to that third part, and get into a bit more of the movie's documentary aspect in the middle part, an exploration of the documentary as 'book' in the middle section.
 
 
 
 Oh, also I believe you need a pic! Somewhere in there. There were so many amazing shots in that film, I'm sure you can find a great screenshot online. Or, I'm not sure if this is possible with html but I believe it is, I bet you could link the trailer here from Youtube and use that as your pic? That might give readers the best idea of the film."
"Some quick grammar fixes I noticed:
 
 ""two hundred years in the future to a world that is recognizable yet alien""--I don't think this is grammatically wrong, I'm not sure, but I feel like ""two hundred years into a future world that is recognizable yet alien"" might read a bit smoother? Totally up to you, of course, but I just wanted to throw it out there.
 
 ""Truly a novel that inspires the reader to at least acknowledge that sustainability and human equality is possible.""--This sentence doesn't have a subject, I think it might make more sense to say ""Lllewellyn has written a novel that truly inspires the reader to acknowledge that sustainability and human equality is, at the very least, possible,"" or something like that. That authors name has so many L's!
 
 
 
 I don't have too much other constructive feedback, I think your choice of novel and why it is a future book is so right on. I guess maybe your title could be a little more powerful, but that is me straining for some more feedback to give you, to be honest. I think you have room to add some more descriptors in there, which might hook the reader in a bit more and pull them down into your assignment--your summary is so intriguing, but your title doesn't match that. Maybe: ""News from Gardenia by Robert Llewellyn is a utopian science fiction novel created, in part, by its readers.""
 
 
 
 Also, I'm not sure the sentence where you say you feel disloyal saying it isn't from the future is very clear. The whole wording of this part has to be sort of awkward as we're talking about a ""future"" book, and so it is awkward to figure out how to take about that, but you are saying it is from the future, right? So maybe ""This is from the future because"" because you aren't saying it isn't from the future? Does that make sense?"
The author certainly supports that podcasts are a way forward for creative works. There are a number of outside sources within the Field Guide that support the idea that podcasts and recorded audio work in general could surpass the written word as a way to consume both fiction and non-fiction.
"I may be wrong in this assessment, but I believe that the ""description"" aspect of the assignment was to be less focused on the content of the novel and more on what makes the novel different from other novels. As the author notes, the content itself isn't unique in that sense. I would suggest refocusing the ""description"" on the process of the publication, rather than the content. That way, it would clear-up plenty of space in the ""Future Factor"" section to discuss how this process shows us a way forward in the future of the book."
"I have very few criticisms of this work. Perhaps it would be beneficial to distinguish between these sorts of websites and an ""ordinary"" website dedicated to a particular piece of fiction. For example, would the myriad of fan-made websites be considered a part of this expansion of the book, or would it be limited to author-run websites?"
"Your description was excellent, but I feel that your argument as to why this should be considered afuture book was lacking. To me it felt as if you were defending it against modern technology instead of embracing it as part of our future and where books are going. I think if you removed these sentences it might help alleviate that defensive stance:Scanimation books are impossible to recreate in digital format. If one was to do so, it would entirely devalue the retro novelty and simply exist as crude animation, like an animated gif.""
 
 
 
 Also, in your description, when you said11 Iconic Scenes from a Galax Far, Far Away¦ Galax should be Galaxy."
"This entry provides a detailed account of the author's ""future"" book."
"I thought the field draft was well written, however in terms of the book's future factor I would like to know more about why other books would follow suit. It is clearly stated what makes the book different now, but what makes it special enough to be the future for other books?"
"When reading the future factor I would like to know more about why this type of format is a natural progression. Would certain people not find it tedious? It is true that it may be a richer experience for those who are willing to try, but in all honesty how many people are willing to work and read? We live in an age where easy access and fun at your fingertips is most popular. So what makes this book accessible and how will other books follow?"
The student has provided sufficient background for his/her future book as well as a convincing and believable argument as to why the format for such a book will become even more popular.
"Perhaps the student could explain why it would be a good idea for Emily C. to have her work only accessible online. The student has done a great job explaining why it was savvy for Emil C. to use her online resources, but why not also publish in print? What about people who are still reading physical books and struggle with the digital age? How will authors like Emily C. ease the people drifting behind into the future of e-books and online videos?"
This entry highlights a very recent innovation. The case for this being futuristic is easy to make. I don't think it is a stretch to anticipate an increase in supporting content for novels. I agree that we will very likely see more of this type of interactive website in the future.
This entry falls short in providing an actual example of this particular hybrid ebook. I think a field guide should focus on one example and describe the execution in detail.
"I loved this entry. It is hard to come up with comments here; however, if I was to try to make an argument for the future factor of audio books I would cite the increase in handheld smart phone devices, blue tooth car interfaces, and other technological advancements which make audio books easier to consume.
 
 
 
 I would be very surprised if there wasn't readily available data regarding a correlation between increase in tablets and audio book popularity."
"This entry could focus a little bit more on the history of the book, and how e-readers fall into the development of the book. Furthermore, the author could touch on the ways in which people interact with e-readers today."
"The description section could be a little bit longer. After reading it, I was still wanted to know more. I would also discuss the history of children's book, and how they have progressed briefly that way there is a comparison with the future."
"This entry could delve into the history of the book, and how this is represents the future of the book. The assignment called for what happens in 1000 to 5000 years, so perhaps a more complete picture of what makes this ""futuristic"" is necessary."
"The summary of the book could be a little more specific. What formats are you talking about? The description section, while it is well-written, seems out of place for this assignment. The only futuristic thing about this book seems to be the plot line, until it is explained that it is a crowdsourced book. The author could speak a lot more to the futuristic elements of that, as oppose to a summary of the book."
"This entry could do more to find the futuristic nature of the book. Specifically, the line, ""This additional element of art makes the book futuristic as well,"" doesn't really make sense because art has been incorporated in books for thousands of years. What/how will we be living that makes this book so applicable to the future?"
The author clearly describes the book in great detail as far as its physical look and appearance and gives a good comparison helping the audience understand somewhat what scanimation is.
"There are some minor editing errors that should be seen on a slow re-reading of the entry. Additionally, I was a little bit confused on the concept of scanimation. The author of the entry gives a comparison but I find myself still struggling to see the futuristic qualities of the book. The book sounds like it fits the bill to a futuristic book but also just sounds like a picture a book. Perhaps a little more explanation of scanimation would explain the book better."
The author of this entry perhaps goes to far in re-telling the entire plot of the book. The entry is incredibly long and quite possibly far over the 500 word limit. A tighter description of the futuristic qualities of the book and a lot less plot telling would make the entry more successful as a field study guide. Right now it reads more like a book report.
There really isn't much to critique in the negative of this entry.
"The strength in this entry is definitely the hard fact that this concept and company are brand new to most of us reading the entry. The description and use of persuasive language in the description was exceptional. It made me want to watch the video for a second time.
 
 This meets the challenge of the assignment because it is simply an actual attempt at a company predicting the trajectory of where the future of the book will be."
"The strength in this entry is the third section which explains the ""future factor"". While the actual product might not interest me completely, the explanation as to how it represents how we as readers can interact with a story in different ways made me want to check this story out to at least experience the different mediums. 
 
 This entry meets the challenge of the assignment because it provides us with an actual product that is being used by authors and readers today, but is only a glimpse into what is possible in this new technology."
The formatting is a little bit confusing. I could not tell if there were parts that were quotes from the actual links provided.
There are a few grammatical errors in the entry that caused me to have to reread the sentence.
"This entry falls short in two ways. First is a summary and description. I was confused for almost all the post as to what reddit is. Even once I followed the link, I was unsure as to what exactly its function is. There needs to be a more concise explanation as to what it is.
 
 The second way is in its contempt of the book. There are people who will more than likely be offended by how callously the author has decided to write of the importance of books. Maybe by explaining why they think reddit will replace physical books and bookstores, the reader will have better insight as to why the thought is replacement versus growing alongside them."
"This entry's strength is it's description of the technology. While this is the second entry to describe a technology that interacts with books in the form of an app, it explains the technology in a way that I am able to picture in my mind.
 
 This meets the challenge of the assignment because it introduces the readers to a new way to interact with printed books."
This entry falls a bit short in the summary section. I think it might be the grammar in the first sentence that throws me a bit off as to what the actual product is. This is better described in the second section and there is a moment where the concept is clarified in my mind as a reader.
"The strengths are definitely the added images. This is something that I forgot about in my assignment, and none of the other reviews that I'm doing are for entries that include pictures at all. I think that this entry did an excellent job enticing me to read the book. I agree that Pessl's ""Night Film"" can be described as a future book because of the extrasensory details that the book includes in order to involve the reader in the story.
 
 
 
 I think it meets the challenge of the assignment because it has expertly addressed every aspect of the project and made me want to go out and read this book!"
"This entry meets the challenge of the assignment because I believe that it is a representation of a future book, albeit for personal reasons only."
"I think that the author of this entry was feeling very strong about the book that s/he chose. This allowed for a more passionate feeling about the book which makes the reader of this entry want to read the book and to see the accompanying film and apps! I think its really cool that this book has other platforms that go along with it aside from just different pictures like we saw in ""A Dodo at Oxford"". This ties the book to more recent modes of media which I found very interesting."
"If anything, I felt like this could have used more detail in order to make it a little bit longer. The length and the voice of the entry didn't seem to go hand in hand. I felt the passion that was coming through in the writing, but then it ended before I wanted to."
I think the subject of this entry is very interesting and is something that I would enjoy taking a look at. Its also a reference to some iconic pop culture which I think will still be relevant in the future. I think this meets the challenge of the assignment because it ties together the past and the future in a way that I think could be relevant for anyone.
"I think a way to really improve this would be to include videos in this entry. This field guide is an online field guide, so it only makes sense to provide links to videos that would help show how documentaries will be the future of the book. 
 
 
 
 ""Take for example"" in the summary doesn't fit with the rest of the assignment, it is self-explanatory. Also, choose what you want your focus to be on- do you want it on ""Babies"" or on documentaries as a whole? If you choose to focus more on ""Babies"", then include it in your conclusion of how this is a future book. If you choose to focus on documentaries on a whole, then I would omit the reference to ""Babies"" and include clips from different documentaries to prove your point."
"I specifically thought the description that focused on the Alice program was direct, easy to follow and clearly showed how the program furthered the reading experience through an immersive experience for the reader - it was the most effective and impactful description and really showed how books can incorporate future technology in order to evolve."
"Because the programs are very unique and many readers could be unfamiliar with their concepts I feel that the first two programs, Nelson and Coupland could have benefitted from an expanded description. I understand that the limited word space requires succinct phrasing, and the current descriptions do a fine job of describing the programs actual functions, but specific examples of something a reader could do while using the app (instead of just describing general functions) and how it would benefit the reader might have clarified the apps purpose and place in the future of the book, making the description a bit easier to understand, especially to those who are unfamiliar with the programs."
"While I like the ideas and direction of the ""future book"" entry, I think it would benefit from a slightly stronger focus on how this can shape the direction of books and readership. The author mentions that this idea could be applied to other books and other genres, it would be worth it to consider how one could do so, how could authors make the interaction for books uniquely individual like Rowling did, and what will that do for reading - will being able to participate in such and interactive and immersive world drastically change how people read? There are several interesting and unique applications this type of site has to books in the future and I think the analysis of the future section could benefit from some slightly deeper analysis to truly convince readers how this could change reading forever."
"I thought the description of just what makes Pottermore a future book was well crafted and straight to the point. Not only did it show how it represents something new in the formatting and use of books by explaining the interactive websites use as a digital extension of the printed world to be used in conjunction with the books, but it mentioned why this was successful - people depend upon technology. In the other posts I have read, not many authors focused on why their type of book was sustainable and successful for the future of books; this post did in an well though out sentence. Such an explanation helps to solidify the potential of this type of medium and why it could feasibly be incorporated into other books and other genres as people become more and more familiar with and dependent upon technology."
"I would really have liked to see the author expand the ""asthetics"" portion of the description section. The general descriptions of what users can accomplish on Pottermore is direct and well written, but I think those not familiar with the site would be more intrigued if the author were to mention what the site looks like, how its set up (use of the sorting hat and the house systems with quizzes and games, common rooms to interact with other users in, the easter eggs in the interactive sections of the novels etc). This set-up is part of the large appeal of Pottermore and is crucial to it's success as an interactive site, so I feel that some attention does need to be given to it's physical appearance and practical uses in the description section."
"I thought the focus on the emotional reaction of the reader based on the text was intriguing and a very interesting way to show readers that the future of the books does not necessarily have to involve technology in a traditional way. The descriptions of the multiple formats and uses of texts (and their purposes) truly showed not only the versatility of font and format, but its importance, and just how deeply the presentation of words in a story can effect the readers emotional well being or reflect the state of the character or the world of the book in a visceral way. The idea that the technological advances of books does not have to mean their conversion to ebooks or their forced incorporation of technology was interesting and well presented."
"While the description of the types of fonts and formats is well presented and well reasoned, if feel including more detail of just how the use of those tools effects the emotional response/connection to the work of the reader would have helped sell the appeal of this type of book more. By just focusing on the detailed and complex uses of the font and format (while informative, important and well done in the original post) the book can come off as daunting or confusing, which may work for some readers, but in general feels like a hard sell to get people interested. By incorporating how those techniques create a unique and intriguing experience for the reader however, and why that experience of House of Leaves is unique, people might be far more willing to go into the book with an open mind and spirit and not be turned off to the idea of this type of media in general."
The strength of your rough draft is that you explained the usages of a blog very thoroughly and what a blog encompasses.
"Unless I read the title of your subject, I would not have understood what you were necessarily writing about, I kept waiting to read which particularblog you were discussing, however, you were speaking generally about blogs as a whole. Possibly bring up an example of a blog group that you have found very useful or interesting so that the reader could be directed to those and they could experience what you are describing. You spoke of tragedies, possibly reference where you read about a child drowning or cancer that struck you so interesting that you mentioned it here."
"The strength of your draft are that you clearly describe the journey of Emily C. chronologically detailing her story as a vegan, among other aspects of that such as including recipes. I also found it strong that you mentioned howe-books are the wave of the future and the items that are now extinct that once captured memories."
"The weakness of your paper is that you started off strong regarding Emily C. however finished somewhat generic with discussing an entire realm of futuristic literature. I am conflicted here because I do feel that the information you stated was important (one of the strengths I listed above) yet, I think you should find a more solid connection with Emilys journey. You mentioned that she was not associated with a publishing company, did she attempt to be published? Was publication a more difficult choice to spreading her story than e-book? I believe the convenience of publication online could be discussed, wherein that is also important to why she most likely decided to go this route, publishing a book is a confusing and long journey, yet the instantpublishing online does the job; thus the reason for so many disappearing bookstores."
The strength of your article is that you clearly described the benefits of a hybrid book and contrasted it with an actual book to where I could understand why you would prefer a hybrid book.
"The weakness of your article would be several grammatical errors, however I understood and followed what you were saying with no problem. I think your article could have had more bearing if you described one particular hybrid book."
"The only thing that I would offer as a grammatical change is to not begin a paragraph with the word ""it"". Everything was wonderful as far else as I could see. The entire assignment flowed very well and was interesting."
"I did not find any weaknesses in your paper, as I stated previously, everything flowed very well and you held my interest."
"The motion does match the description I suppose, although I don't get the sense that the square is walking or running. It honestly just looks like it is tweeking out. The object does change colors though when its speed changes. Aesthetically, I think the program is quite pleasing."
The motion matches the description from everything that I can see. However I believe we were told to come up with some sort of description that was more story-related. In this case maybe the walker is a person with paranoia who runs when he thinks something is coming after him. Otherwise this sketch does what it is described and I love the screen wrapping.
Motion depicts the description ! running period can be increased to make it distinct.the difference between walking and running will be more noticeable apart from color change.
"The description isn't very accurate because it seems that the walker mostly runs at the same speed. I mostly see green squares of where the walker was, but every once and awhile i'll see a red one. The colors don't seem to clearly show a difference in speed for me. The walker seems to mostly be walking the whole time instead of running."
"The description matches the patch exactly. Great job, I like the idea of it being a bird."
"Yes, the motion does the description of the behavior of Question 2. The ""bird"" does fall blue, and then flies and goes green. However, the motion is not contained in the window, so instead of falling to the ground, it's a loop of the ""bird"" falling."
"Yes, the motion matches the description. I see the blue as the bird falls and then the green rotating rectangle as it tries to fly, then the motion is repeated on a loop."
"Yes, the motion matches. But I am not sure what ""moves East"" means; it appears to move in a random direction when it tries to fly. But the way that the majority of the distance traveled while falling is straight down with only small variation is realistic for a free fall."
The motion matches the description very well as it definitely seems like a bird is continually falling and trying to fly. the different states do a fine job to mimic this.
"The motion matched the description very well. After reading the description, I felt that the different rectangles became different people. Their movement were unique and vivid that gave the ""street""(the window) life. Also he used different color changed when a new column of rectangle showed up. Very impressive."
"Yes, because the squares are moving in the upward direction but stopping every now and then to ""sidestep"" and then continue in the upward direction."
"The movement more or less matches the description, although it seems this person is stuck walking in a VERY crowded area. Maybe Time Square."
"Good job. The walker matches the description pretty well. I think it's interesting that the rectangle can only move in four directions rather than diagonally as well. It wasn't noticeable at first, but it's different from the class example. I also like the color changes."
"The description does match the behavior, but I find it hard to see it as a rocket. When the rocket teleports back the bottom and changes color it seems like it is a separate object. If the the rocket were to bounce of the walls I think the piece would make more sense."
"It matches. The rectangle moves very slowly for 3 seconds and then starts moving fast. When it exceeds the top, it appears again at the bottom and changes a color."
"I think the description of your sketch is pretty accurate. It reminds me of fireworks rather than rockets, with all that changing colors. However, the only thing that threw me off was the mousePressed action. When I click on the screen, the trail disappears, and it doesn't seem like a rocket/fireworks anymore. Other than that, good job on the sketch!"
"The motion satisfies the purpose of the assignment, though there are no constraints to limit its movement inside the screen."
"It basically does. Though, there's not food. :/
 
 
 
 
 
 Also, I noticed that there was nothing to keep them from going outside of the window."
"Yes, the description matches the animation perfectly."
"Yes the sketch does match the description above for this project. I think this is a great project that had a lot of effort put into it, and the objects really do look like butterflies with various rectangle shapes fluttering around and ""showing up"" one right after the other. They do stay within a small access, while still fluttering randomly."
The description matches the general behavior of the sketch although I think there could have been more details. In addition to their description the butterflies were changing color and leaving a trail.
Haha! This is awesome and very creative. Their movements are very much like butterflies. motion matches the description.
The motion that I see matched the behavior in Question 2 because the movement of the character goes to the bottom left and then stays idle.
"It matches. Once the program starts to run, the walker starts to walk towards the bottom-left corner, kinda staggered. But it's not clear if the robot, after reaching the bottom-left corner, stops at that particular position or just moves out side of the window."
"The description of the sketch accurately describes the motion of the object. I feel it's ironic though that the Rumba leaves behind a trail of ""paint"" instead of cleaning."
The both the creative description and coding description match exactly with what is occurring in this code. It is a fun description and the amount of detail you used in both explanations is very well done.
"Yes, the cool walker does move more vertically and the warm walker moves more horizontally. They both stay in the box and move about randomly and quickly."
"Yep. Sometimes the walkers move so fast they are a bit hard to follow, but their behavior matches the description."
The motion matches the description in Question 2 because the character overlap constantly with their consistent colors.
"Yes, the description matches the motion well. The red, raging parolee frantically paces in his home, quickly filling all the available space. Then it bolts from the home. It is a very nice looking animation, and becomes pretty funny when the story is told."
"Yes, the motion matches the description. The rectangle moves but stays within a confined area at the center of the screen. After a period of time it begins to move randomly outside of that area. The color changes from a light to dark red while trapped, then from a light to dark cyan when free. It could have been programmed to continue walking randomly on an infinite loop once free, instead of stopping or moving outside the screen."
The animation clearly shows that someone is pacing back and forth which perfectly resembles someone who is on house arrest.
Yes because the rectangles are all centered in the window and continues to stay in that area for a considerable amount of time.
"The motion represented by the sketch matched the description of behavior in the assignment. The walker would turn more and more red each frame that progressed, until the 30 seconds were up. As soon as the time was up, the walker started to turn cyan like it was supposed to. It also started going around, but at a certain point, it went off screen and I didn't see it again."
The behavior seems to exhibit the described actions just fine.
"The motion does match the description, but the description seems a little vague. It does speed up and slow down like the author describes. The animation is also a bit boring to look at. Don't be afraid to add color."
I cant really see that its speeding up or slowing down. You said you wanted it to pop up on the other side of the window if it went out of bound and it did do that.
"Yes. The motion matches the description. It starts slow, speeds up, slows, speeds up... It worked exactly how it is described."
For the most part yes because the rectangles seem to speed off after some time but then tend to cluster for a bit as well.
"Yes, it sort of reminded me of fireworks, the way it explodes for 4 seconds and fireworks sort of leave a trail of smoke after it's done and then you have to load up the next firework so it stays in it's spot for 2 seconds and waits for it to be shot up."
The patch matches the description very well. Awesome job.
It seems match the description. I can see both the rotation and the moving of the walker. But I'd like to see which kind of character does this walker looks like.
"It really does. Mainly talking about the end there, you don't need an explanation to see that it looks like bubbly water spouting out from the ground. Nicely done."
"The motion of the sketch is as described in question 2. The rectangle draws itself a couple of times around on the screen and skips to the middle of the screen then repeats again. However, what the description says about the duration of each behavior is a bit off by a couple of seconds. The rectangle moves around for about 1 to 2 seconds and then draws in the middle of the screen for less than 1 second."
The movement is a cool and funny one and it meets all the requirements.
It sure does match it. The description is pretty clever and fitting to what I saw. Good job!
"I sort of see it. It's very quick on how it reacted to seeing a celebrity, but it seems calm most of the time. It looks like the walker object continues going in random directions and it doesn't head back to its cosy little area."
This is one of my favorites; it's very different. You did a really good job depicting the fluttering wings and the basic movement of a fly. Good job.
"Yes, the motion matches the description well. It is obviously a fly. While sometimes the fly flies backwards, the twitchy erratic flight and the size changes really sell it."
"The motion perfectly matched what was written in the second question. The fly changes states every 2.5 seconds, and it has the four different actions. The only thing is that it wasn't a rectangle, but as the student wrote, the ellipse just looks better."
Yes it does. The fly seems to move in random patterns every few seconds and has several different behaviors.
"The description fits the behavior, for the most part; it does resemble lighting in slow motion. Though, it does not really look like it was changing color on my screen."
The sketch exhibits the described behavior very well.
Yes. The motion described is performed by the rectangle.
"The motion is similar to the way it is described in the description. The squares do move similarly to a lightning bolt, although I don't actually see the color changing like the author suggests. It's also a little weird to say it's repeatedly trying to hit the ground. That illustration of the animation seems a little forced."
"Yes it does match the description above. The lines of squares are moving from the top to the bottom right corner looking like a lightening bolt. I also like the transparent blue that they made. When I clicked the mouse and held it down the squares turned red, but when I released it went back to blue."
"The actions of the walker are described well, my only suggestion is when the walker goes off screen have it come through the other sider and not towards the middle."
"The walker matches the description, but seems almost identical to the example given in class that had the walker tend to travel right. The only difference in the actual movement is that instead of wrapping the screen cleanly, there is a 400 pixel gap that the walker won't travel. Also, you do not describe how you coded any of it, so it appears that you just took the class example and made a few minor aesthetic changes."
"it does. What I would change about it, though, is that I would reset the squares on random points of the width as well. This is because when life sets you back, it can either be a little or a lot. Also because after a while, one side of the screen is left blank, making it look kind of lopsided. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 P.S. When I played it at first, it shaped out would looked like a running fox with a flaming tail. Thought that was cool."
"Umm, how does that describe the behavior of the walker object? This isn't supposed to be an artists statement but a description of the behavior of your walker object by using some behavior that is found in the natural world or described through a character of some kind. The Sporadic adjective does kinda work since the movement seems random, but I would really try to make your object link to something in life besides a square."
"The motion fits the description in terms of it moving wild and sporadically, however, your description seems a little vague or open for interpretation. It might be a bit of a stretch to say the motion mimics us fighting for what we want."
The walker matches the behavior in that it stays still while moving slightly for a while before 'jumping' to a close by area. With the strokeWeight it gives the walker a cool fading effect that adds to the jumping idea.
Good job! The walker matches the description very well. It moves in a small area for a short while and then jumps to a new spot on the screen. It was obvious that the code was original and easy to understand.
Yes. The character seems to move in any direction and it also returns to the center when it goes out of the 500x500 boundry.
"I do not believe the motion matches the description. Perhaps the speed needs to be decreased, it is not visible when the rectangle is standing still to save energy - there seems to always be movement. However, I do notice when the rectangle is moved 30 units away from a point."
"Yes, it does create the look of hand drawn spirals. I thought your use of expanding the radius was neat."
"Your description of what is occurring is not done in the way that was asked. You did describe it correctly, but just not as a character in a movie. However, the creating of spirals is really cool and entertaining to watch."
"Description and actual sketch look to be matching, but it's not described as if it was a character in a movie.
 
 This is also a really cool design. Great job!"
The crazy colorful motions do match the description you gave for your walkers behavior.
"Yes, it does, I like how you were able to use the millis(), I had a hard time understanding how to make that work."
"The motion described is actually described pretty well, and with your description it actually made the program come alive more than it normally would. You used the colors of the rect to help the viewer go deeper into your narrative, and it helps the viewers imagination create a world in their own heads using your sketch, This is a good mix of art and programming."
"I really like the creativity in the description. I think the description was made to fit the animation, but I feel it works here. The animation does display the erratic behavior of the scenario you presented. Visually, it is very fun, although the rapid switching between grays can be a little displeasing to watch."
"Yes, it does seem like the walker is running around before circling in the same spot then running around randomly again."
"The assignment matches the description, it works well in that the rapid movements are done with larger squares while the smaller circling movements are matched with smaller squares."
"The sketch was quite unexpected. I had expected a large rectangle travelling down the screen and found one that was small and nearly transparent. However, I like how well it matches the actions of a parachute explorer. The response in question 2 matches the behavior of the rectangle as like that of the parachute explorer, giving me a better sense of what is happening on the screen."
Felt like I just had opened a pop up window on the internet inviting me to play a game.
"Simple and straight to the point, this patch was fun and easy to use. The primary sound was simple but slightly annoying (perhaps like a good 'no' sound should be. The surprise of the 'yay' when I found the yes key was extremely pleasing and the the fireworks certainly added a cool surprise."
"Simple structure but effective, the added graphics were great but unexpected because they had not come up in class as an option within the creative process of this software. Seems like I am learning a lot about what the possibilities for more user friendly interface design. My only critic was that the buttons at the bottom could have been lined up more symmetrically."
"The introduction of the header and master audio switch is a novel idea that is aesthetically pleasing and improves immensely the ease with which the viewer can control the program and use it correctly. The presence of the links between the different objects, necessary as they may be, slightly detract from the quality of the header and switch button. The actual working part of the program seems slightly clunky due to the zigzagging wires crossing through one another and the yes/no button signals. The organization of the patch elements and including more novel sounds will make the patch perfect."
"This patch is very similar to that of the patch we went over in class. The good key and bad key branches are the same with two sfplay~ messages, two meters, two ezdac~ messages, minus the different sounds that correspond to each of them. There is also a comment box that says ASCII value for the intended ASCII number code."
"While I was using this patch, I was very confused by the good key and bad key sounds. The sound for the bad key element did not sound as negative as I would want it to be. The good key element, with the sound being a bell ringing, was a good choice for determining what the good key was but, the choice for the bad keys was questionable with it being just a simple drum hit."
The way how this patch was approached was the same way as the patch that we went over in class. Something that was different that I saw was the addition of the comment speech bubble. I did not know that that was a way that comments can be presented and is definitely something that I learned.
The patch is very simple and it's easy to understand the signal flow.
"The patch is very simple to use, but overall not very user friendly. For example, in order for the patch to work the user must load the clips and then turn on the sound. Adding some comments would help the user know what to do. PS! Thanks for not using the most annoying failure sound!! A lot of other patches use really annoying failure sounds and, since you end up hearing it over and over it gets really annoying. So thanks for using something that's not horrible!"
"There is nothing technically wrong with the patch, however, the patch only needs one sound control, you don't need a second exdac object."
When getting the right key it plays a sound very similar but more inviting then when hitting the wrong key.
The bad key has that weird ambient noise and good key is more like an electronic music tone.
"This patch is another short and simple patch but i feel like it needs more room to be able to see more clearly, since it is a short assignment it does not hurt to spread them out a bit more."
The program worked perfectly and it was interesting to hear different sounds and nothing repetitive. All they have to do is spread their projects out more in future projects.
"I like the simple layout and the description used to navigate the user into understanding the patch and what it does. They approached it the same way we approached it in class whereas one key is good, and the other key is bad. They could have made more good keys."
Pretty simple patch. Not complicated to look at.
The good key is pretty entertaining with the beavis and butthead laugh.
It was just like the example in class.
It's pretty basic and straightforward. Lots of notes to let you know what's going on. Simple.
"It feels like the 'no' feedback sound is too long and drawn out, yet the 'yes' sound is great and entertaining. It leads to a really annoying experience until I get the right key."
the formula shown in class was used in this assignment.
The patch was neat and organized. But a few of the pieces like the buttons didn't need to be there.
"There was some key hunting, and the 'no' sound, which was from Sonic, was a little grating to the ears after a while because of how loud it was being played. The 'yes' sound highly amused me, the victory sound from any given Final Fantasy game. It did feel like a victory after finally finding the 'good' key. It was a nice experience overall."
it was pretty simple only thing i would have done differently would be shortening the victory sound file
"The patch is very clean, everything is laid out in straight lines and is extremely easy to understand. There are no unnecessary elements in the patch."
"The bad key sound is extremely annoying so it really makes you want to find the right button quickly. I also liked how the good key's sound went on for a rather long time. It gave me a sort of Super Mario feel, similar to when the game is beaten and the credits start to roll."
"The patch is a simple variation of the assignment, and looks very clean. It is structure neatly from top to bottom and I know how the patch flows."
"The bad key is bad indeed, it makes you want to hurry and find the good key. Now the good key is rewarding, I do believe it is from a video game and I cannot recall which but hearing it makes me feel as though i just beat an intense level of some sorts."
"Seems as if they recreated the very minimum technicality needed to fulfill the requirements of this projects, fortunately the sounds were entertaining. After looking at the sub patch I realize that there was a bit more thought put into than I realized. Appreciated being able to go in and look at the inner workings of the project. May have been fun to have some other sounds included. Always learning, realize I am going to have to up the ante next time!"
"I learned how to select multiple keys/values using the select object, which was something I was trying to do when creating my patch, and for some reason I just couldn't get it to work. Despite my confusion, I think this person did a pretty good job on the assignment. They achieved something completely unique to what I have seen so far. My one suggestion would be to find clearer and possibly shorter sounds."
"I think that the sound quality is a little bit poor, so I can hear a lot of noise. The style of the music isn't in my area of interest, but I think it's pretty cool."
"The functionality is simple to use, which is great. There was a voice recording of the word hallelujah and a voice recording of word your wrong. Even when I had my volume on high they were still hard to hear, and the word, ""your wrong"" was very hard to make out. I think the simplicity of the words chosen is good because it is obvious as it relates to this project. I feel the user experience would be straight forward in terms of the literal, ""good key/bad key"" assignment."
"Technically the patching looks fine. It looks like the assignment was followed exactly, the only thing I did not see was the meter. I did not see anything out of the norm in terms of a new feature or function that was not assigned. I really do like the visual aesthetics were very appealing. I did not learn anything new from the way the programming was completed. I think would could have possible been improved was just the recording sound of the wave files, they were just really low."
"It is cute and funny. I like that the bad key sound is ""aint nobody got time for this"" and that when you find the ""good key"" it rewards you with a strongyea!. The sounds were very fast and clipped very tight. It made it feel abrupt."
The first thing I noticed was there were no comment boxes. The coding was not complicated but instead met the minimum requirement and was straight forward.
"It is small and compressed, which I like, but the opening window was very large. It it clean and well placed, easy on the eyes. However, there are no comments, which would make it difficult to follow."
"This is another bare bones basically and neatly structured patch. If they wanted to do more they could have used background colors, made the key a bit more difficult to find with key combinations, and other slightly more complicated additions to the game."
"It was fairly straight forward so I did not learn anything new in the coding. I think to do this better the author could have added the select message to operate the program to make sound. I think the clarity was well accomplished, and in the future they can focus on being more technically intense."
"Aside from the sounds and extra meter, I'd say this patch was pretty run of the mill. I didn't really see a use for the extra meter, but it did add a little extra visual component to the project. One thing I think could be improved is that there was a little extra length of ""noise"" at the end of the yes soundbite and that probably could have been trimmed off."
"They seemed to have decided to just stack the codes on top of each other which worked. I think comments would have made for a better experience, so I could test the patch quickly without having to google the right code. I would have added the comment boxes for faster testing."
"I would have liked more notes and the whole thing just seemed a little crammed together. There's space! Use it! There's also a number box with a -127, and I'm not sure why."
"So, the ASCII code for their selected value is 22, but that doesn't actually correspond to a keyboard input, so it didn't actually function in the way I would hope."
"The patch looks very good, and is condensed a lot. But still looks like it took some technical abilities to make."
"The patch is very simple, but the creator could have added a few things to make it easier to the user. Firstly, comments that tell the user to turn on the sound, for example, would make is user friendly. Secondly, adding a few features like the ability to pick the ""success"" key would be a great feature for this patch."
The patch itself gives off a very good feel. It was not as clear as some of the others and at first it looks like they may have missed a step but they just simplified it to the very core.
Simple and not as developed as it could have been. On a positive note it was not intimidating.
"Basic concept, kind of monotonous and it took me while to find the 'yes' key! The redeeming factor was the 'yes' sound was crazy and strange and interesting which made it worth the wait."
The patch looks very simple. Easy to understand what is intended.
"I was not able to get the patch to run. However, the description that was provided makes the patch seem like a very neat idea. I liked that the idea was musical and hope to see something like this that works."
"The patch was approached as expected. However, the way that they used musical elements was particularly interesting."
Doesn't look like its going to work.
Couldn't get the code to work. I'm not sure if this is a problem on my end.
Couldn't get it to work.
I could not get your keys to open and play. When I unlocked it to check if they were linked to a file by double clicking on it nothing happened.
"Right off the bat, I noticed that there would be more than two sounds that could possibly be played, and probably some at the same time. No descriptions to how the sounds can be made by each part, but from looking at it one can guess what's going on with it."
"There was a really cool and neat idea in the patch that somehow along the way didn't come through. I don't know if something had a wrong path, or something. I did see two message boxes before the speaker, so I don't know if that was the problem or not. The idea was exiting, but sadly I couldn't hear it."
Clean looking patch
"nothing out of the ordinary, just the basic patch from the video."
"Visually logical and simple, including colored buttons indicating ""correct"" and ""incorrect"" input."
"Nothing about the patch is surprising from a technical perspective, but it works well."
"Nicely laid out, and the two buttons, one for 'yes' and the other for 'no', are color coordinated for the user's convenience. Everything is labelled, and even which key is the 'good one' is spelled out as to leave out the guess work."
"It was a quick experience, but pleasant. The sounds were not obnoxious and nicely leveled. The sounds were traditional positive and negative sounds for guesses, so it wasn't an out of the ordinary experience."
"Technically, it was a simple setup, and nothing too out of the box. Everything worked as it should, and when it should. Nothing exciting, and nothing boring or unusual. As for what could be done better, I got nothing since everything worked and everything was laid out as it should."
They approached it as we did in class except they added buttons with different colors for visually informing when a good/bad key is struck. I learned that the colors of the buttons can be changed to give a visual representation of when keys are struck.
I think they completed the assignment as asked without adding a lot. The buttons are a nice addition to see which side your typing is going through. It adds a good visual cue in addition to the audio output.
"This patcher followed all the right rules and components of this assignment. I still suggest spacing out the buttons/keys to look better and cleaner. In this case, I would also advise on stating which key is the good key for the sake of time for this critique assignment. But it still played the sounds and functioned perfectly."
The sounds are entertaining. It's a bit confusing that the sound is used for both good key and bad key. At first it made me think I had pressed both keys or there was an error in the way it was coded. I then realized the same sound is used within the good key sound as the bad key sound. It's very easy to use and navigate.
"The experience was OK. The sounds were fairly interesting although it was a little confusing. For some reason I though the wrong key was the right key, but that just may be how I took the sound effect."
"Like I said before, it was done very simply. Which is always good. The simpler the better. However, I kinda would have liked to see comments of some sort. If I had no idea what was going on, I would be incredibly lost. Honestly, I didn't really learn anything new from this patch."
"The patch was pretty entertaining to work with and would be something fun to use for a kid. Although, when I was working with It I was confused with what keys I was pressing to make the different sounds. The sounds weren't necessarily ""good"" or ""bad"" therefore I think the keys I was pressing should have been more straight forward but they felt random."
The sounds are simple and not very entertaining in my opinion. The good key is kind of exciting but runs a bit longer than I'd like it to. The experience I get is just wanting to press many different keys over and over
"The visual appearance is definitely uniform and appealing conceptually by the simplicity of the design. It definitely allow for a user interface that is not intimidating. I really like the sounds in this patch, they are entertaining. The bad key, had the wah, wah, wah zany sound effect, which is definitely a fitting sound for this key. They good key was great, it reminded me of being in an amusement park riding on a roller coaster."
