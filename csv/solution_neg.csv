"All three of the questions were answered, but, in my opinion, were a little vague. The answers stated pretty much what they wanted to do, but I didn't read very much thought being put into these answers. All questions are answered clearly, just not in a very detailed manner."
"In all of the projects, he or she discusses the use of lasers. Though the projects are very similar in their use of lasers, they are also fairly different ideas. The student made a good effort to expand upon their ideas and give details. They want one project using lasers as a form of data transfer, laser interactive project and another basic max/patch laser project."
Using a laser to initiate sounds while playing a game. Passing data via laser doesnt seem plausible to me.
"There are definitely three separate ideas proposed, but all based around similar technology: lasers. All seem like pretty solid ideas; one being to make a simple environment where laser are pointed at targets to create musical tones, another using laser signals to beam data between devices, and the last using lasers for a target practice type game."
"I feel the student elaborated enough to get o good idea of what they are aiming for.
 
 The first idea is to create some kind of musical instrument incorporating lasers.
 
 The second idea is to use lasers to send information to different devices they also stated that some of the technology may need to be further developed.
 
 The last idea is some sort of shooting game with lasers and a projector."
The first one the student wants to make is a music system which controlled by some unique instruments. The second one is to build anthropopathic robot soldiers. The third one is to build a virtual reality glove.
"Overall, I believe this person put a decent amount of thought into the ideas. Each idea is written vividly and thoroughly. 
 
 The first idea is basically to create a device that generates midi sounds with an arduino and some buttons/knobs. 
 
 The second idea is basically creating remote control soldiers for the use of the army, essentially making military deaths a thing of the past.
 
 The third idea is to create a glove that works with the oculus rift to track hand movements to be translated into the virtual world within the oculus rift."
"These projects - a simple midi controller, soldier drones, and a video game glove - have all been proposed many times. We see these types of things all the time in movies, and occasionally in real life. It doesn't seem like the thinking was stretched very much, but that previous ideas were re-used."
"This student made a sincere effort in proposing the ideas, as each one feels thought out to the extent that they can be in such a short amount of time. The first idea was to make a midi controller, which seems to require hardware that is simple to make and some programming that this student is not confident in doing. The second idea was to make unmanned robots that function similarly to human beings, allowing soldiers to control one as if it was their own body without the risk of death. The third idea was a glove for virtual reality that can mimic the actions of the player, allowing the player to interact with the virtual world similarly to the real world, potentially with haptic feedback."
"The answers displayed here show that a lot of thought was put into these questions. Everything was answered clearly and concisely, with lots of detail and creativity."
I like the idea of having an app that allows you to interact with a concert you are attending. I also like the idea of having sort of one central app that allows you to research and donate to causes around the world. I think that would be the best bet.
"The ideas feel somewhat proposed as they are, though I'm left with many questions as to how something would be made or how complicated it would be. The first idea talks about skills more than what can be accomplished. It seems that this student is not entirely aware of what they can do with their skillset, specifically due to lack of programming knowledge. The second idea is understandable yet I'm not sure as to how this would take a large amount of money and time. It feels like setting up an incredibly large and intricate information system, then giving that information to the user in a simplified format. The third idea is clear though the student does not write about how something like that is feasible; I feel that it's less of a technical project on the student's end and would mostly require interacting with and convincing the performers and producers at the concert to let them hook up things for the app to work."
"I would say that ideas 2 and 3 are definitely more focused with and objective, however though I am impressed with idea 1, it explains more of what your skills are rather than an actual particular project such as ""make a video that does X"" or ""compose a song around X ideas"". I got confused at the beginning of 1 because you state that you could build a website but then later make note that you do not have much programming experience, so I am assuming this would be done by some other means like a template website designer and not actually using HTML and CSS."
"Overall I felt that the student made a good effort to explain their ideas. 
 
 
 
 1. An unspecified rough app or computer program. 
 
 
 
 2. A series of sensors in bikes and/ or cars that alert drivers/ cyclists to potential collisions. 
 
 
 
 3. An app that the city/ police can use to see where cyclist have had accidents or poor experiences so that changes can be made to prevent future accidents."
"This student is looking to create a prototype of an interface that is beneficial to those who like to ride their bicycles on the road and care about their safety. I think they did clearly propose their motivations and thoughts, being concerned with improving public cycling collisions and allowing some sort of warning system."
I believe that some solid effort was put into this by the student. The ideas were well thought out and put lots of variables into consideration with cycling. Cycling is a largely used mode of transportation so these ideas will most likely be successful.
"I like the idea of simplifying things like routes and safety in cycling. I think we could think up ways on how we could branch out with these ideas or even conjure up some more,"
"This student definitely went in depth and was really detailed about what they would do in these situations. I honestly believe they could get a lot done in a week from the first question, do something really awesome and a lot of good from the second question, and continue their project on and make it better in the third answer."
"The first, week-long project would simply be an outline for a longer-term project.
 
 The second idea is to develop some form of cerebral interface for virtual reality games.
 
 The third idea is to create an AI that learns from it's mistakes."
I could help to develop the visual representations for this world the AI will explore or meld with. But that's about all I'd have to offer to this project.
"1) A quick board/video game
 
 2) NCVR - Virtual Reality that is truly immersive (utilizing all senses)
 
 3) Creating an AI
 
 
 
 It seems like they really put some thought into it, as it all seems to build upon each other. However, the semester idea seems perhaps too ambitious."
"He/she has ideas about the game design are related human body and nervous system. His/her plans and ideas are related each other. Also, he/she has rough design concept and I think he/she has potential energy to develop and realize the system. That is not perfect yet, but it would be great project under his/her plans during this collaboration project. Also, his/her NCVR project is not far away from today."
"I can tell that this student is very passionate about virtual reality, as am I. This NCVR sounds like an excellent idea (albeit a little risky) but it would definitely be the next step in VR. Visuals have been covered by systems such as the Oculus Rift, but that's as far as it goes (to my knowledge)."
"By the look of it, I think we could make a really good VR game together. The ideas and goals are all there, we would just need to work for a long time to reach those goals. Game are a huge part of my life so I could think of lots of ideas on how this project could take off."
Yes they made a effort with their three ideas being. 1. To build a moto-Bike of some sort similar to a moped. 2. To create a water powered system to create energy. 3. To make an interactive environment with lasers and such.
I think they thought about what they wanted to do. It was what seemed to be as much elaboration as needed for this type of assignment. It seemed like everything was more or less just an idea and there was nothing that had really been thought of.
1. Put a motor on the bike. 2. Find some thing can save water or other resources. 3. Using laser technology into projection mapping.
"Although they made attempts and I think their ideas were in the right direction because the person wanted to tackle larger problems; however, they didn't propose workable ideas."
"I mean, they didn't really propose anything for the first idea. Technically, they answered the actual question to the fullest, because it asked ""what could you yourself accomplish in a week?"" They said that with one week to do something, they could get the planning phase done, and start to draw up concepts to actually get a finished product. There was no idea stated. For the second, they gave more of an idea of creating a way to make higher education accessible to all those who wish to further their learning, but beyond that there was nothing. The same goes for the third idea, there was not a specific idea to state, but rather that it would be better to work in a group to get stuff done."
"Literally, it's almost impossible to get something done with this students ideas, because there is nothing to go off of. The only thing to go off of would be that we would be coming together for one cause."
"I do not believe that this student took much time and getting this homework assignment or really tried. There isn't much to be able to think about here, and although buying convertibles for everyone sounds like a good idea, it doesn't have anything to do with our major or creating something from nothing."
There is nothing I can collaborate with another student on because they didn't write enough idea down for something to be created in a partnership.
"Idea 1: It is not really a full idea, but rather a general 'first steps to a larger project' outline.
 
 Idea 2: The idea is to assemble a team that can work to find a way to make a college education free for everyone, or to buy everyone a sports car should this team prove unsuccessful.
 
 Idea3: This is not really a full idea either, but it builds on the idea of assembling a team presented in Idea 2.
 
 
 
 While the specifics of the process this student would like use when starting to work on something are fleshed-out a bit, the specifics of what this student would like to do are only expressed in the Second idea concerning free college education. So it is a little vague."
"Ideas 1 and 3 do not have a definitive project idea and are more so how far along one could develop the stages of making an idea in that time, whereas 2 the idea is to find a way to make education free to individuals. In idea one the student states that they could outline and blueprint some rough ideas of what a final project may do, and plan the next stages to get there. In idea 3 the student states that they would recruit a team of individuals to develop a more cohesive project."
"I believe that the student made a sincere effort into their answers for ideas 1 and 2, and to a lesser extent idea 3. Idea 2 could have used some more clarification as I am not wholly sure what these group games are, while idea three could use some expanding upon.
 
 
 
 Their one week idea was to create a mini-game that tested the end users reaction time and post their ""score"" on an internet serve, thus allowing players to rank their times.If they were given no time or money limit they would want to construct a world fitness center that both explores the concept of group games that promote healthy fitness as well as having machines/other equipment that help the users stay fit. They are willing to offer prize incentives for working overtime. For their semester goal they wish they wish to be more involved in their gaming company and create several more games for a college student audience that help them with their class studies."
"Idea 1: a simple game that measures reaction time to different situations, and shows these times against the times of others.
 
 Idea 2: A collection of games that promote exercise and fitness, some of which incorporate gym equipment, all of which are part of a larger businesslike organization.
 
 Idea 3: Expanding an already established gaming company that focuses on college course material.
 
 
 
 This student has clearly-proposed three ideas and has touched on the details and motivations for them."
"The ideas here are fairly well-thought-out. None of these ideas are very detailed, but at this point, they have enough information that can see the thought put into the ideas."
"The first and third ideas - using hand-painted images for a wedding, etc. book, and educational games - have been done many times over. The second idea - changing the look of a building based on internal or external activity - seems like it could be done easily enough, and I don't know that it's been done before."
"There is a coherent project idea in each answer. 
 
 
 
 1. A set of hand painted images than could be formatted into booklets for special occasions. 
 
 
 
 2. An interactive building facade on a skyscraper that changed base don the people in it or by it that highlighted them in some way. 
 
 
 
 3. A business that creates games that are both educational and entertaining."
"I think the student has interesting ideas regarding the exploratory questions of this assignment, but needs to be more specific about their ideas in question 2 and 3. How would the display make the skyscraper building ""less standard""? What are the games that can be played outside of the classroom? 
 
 
 
 His/her three ideas are to create a wedding book of painted stock images, an interactive display of digital arts at the side of a skyscraper, and an educational video games based on a business idea."
"Idea one is to design a game, non-functional, but with the architecture in place. Idea two is to essentially make their own video game development company and eventually build the best game possible. Lastly, idea 3 is to make a small exploration driven game, examples are stated but I have no experience with any of them to know what they may be."
i could help with what goes on in the game. The story line or goal in the game.
1. A first person shooter game. 2. He would like to do many games to gain experiences. Then he will use his experience to do a big game which has important topics to the society. 3.A small exploration driving game.
"As the author mentions, he is a game level designer. So I am interesting in his game level design. It would be fun to explore the key of each level in order to reach the next level. But I have no idea about how to do that. Hope to see your game!"
"I think that you have a few good ideas about what you want to do, however I am a little unclear on both of them. 
 
 
 
 1) For the pistol device that you mentioned in idea 2: Why is it a designed to be pistol like? If you are worried about negligent or improper behavior in a community, why would you shape your device to look like a deadly weapon? Additionally, could you elaborate a little more on what you meant by patrol device? What makes it more or less specialized than a smart phone?
 
 
 
 2) For the mobile app: I too find it interesting to manipulate a mobile device to track social and personal habits. What kind of error proofing will you need to do in order to make sure the mobile app doesn't go off during every quiet situation? Also what kind of habits are you specifically attempting to track? The range of personal and social habits is a pretty broad range."
I think that the student displayed a nicely planned out set of steps that would allow the project to flourished.
"The answer in the first idea is pretty vague. The writer seems more interested in putting down steps for developing an idea rather than actually conceptualizing a project. The second question is more thoroughly thought out and visualized, though there are some privacy and safety questions arising from the idea of a private autonomous, or at least mobile, surveillance system. The third idea is the most feasible, though I would fins it kind of irritating if my phone kept making personal comments about my habits and randomly playing music suddenly when it gets quiet."
"If the student is serious about creating an app, then maybe we could create a storytelling app with a significant visual element, like a web comic but with some interactivity. Maybe a choose your own adventure with dynamic visuals and some animation."
"I like the idea of using patrol devices, but this can be risky since I'm sure they will not be cheap and you have to worry about people messing with or breaking or stealing them. I also like the idea of creating an app as sort of a personal side kick."
I think these ideas are pretty well thought out and practical. The doorknob thing sounds kinda fun. Each of these ideas take the concepts and skills we're developing in DC and applying them in imaginative ways.
I'd love to draw storyboards for this person's Great Wall idea. The idea of displaying cultural history in a visually dynamic way is intriguing to me.
"These seem like a person's scribbled notes, and took me a little bit to decipher. They didn't think the ideas all the way trough to the presentation, just the general idea of it. To me its hard to visualize something if they don't describe the physical parts or generally explain how they would get it done and why it differs from the average idea.
 
 1. A computer program thermometer
 
 2. 3D printing research
 
 3. Virtual joust?"
I think that the student made some really good suggestions about creating a arduino program that has some sort of interactive aspect.
"This person gives a pretty clear idea of what he wants to create, but fails to explain the purpose of creating it. What would set it apart? Why make something like this? Sometimes people don't know about a certain movie so how would you then explain your idea to them?
 
 
 
 1. colored light programmed by arduino
 
 2. Virtual Reality gaming
 
 3. Motion Capture rc car"
"I felt that although these explanations were brief, and could have used a bit more detail, the ideas were expressed relatively clearly in such few words. 
 
 
 
 Idea 1: A program that uses an arduino and three buttons. When a button is pushed, an assigned color appears. 
 
 
 
 Idea 2: A program that makes people feel as though they are part of a virtual reality world. The program would involve the whole body, and the user would feel as though they left the real world and were transported into the game. 
 
 
 
 Idea 3: A program that allows a person to drive a car or fly a plane using only hand movements."
"I really liked the idea of a video game that submerged the user into a virtual world. I think perhaps with a pair of virtual reality glasses, some sort of smart gloves and shoes, and perhaps some sort of outfit that had different sensors sewn into the material, this might be possible. This project would however, likely be very involved, and take a great deal of time and resources to accomplish."
I like your idea of building a simple arduino program with a simple sensor system to interact with the user.
"I think the student made an effort with their ideas, although they could use more information as to what tools they would want to try and use. For example, in his third idea, it is unclear as to what softwares or hardware would be needed in order to control the car or plane.
 
 
 
 Reiteration of ideas:
 
 Idea 1 - Using arduino, make an interactive system with 3 buttons that change colors.
 
 Idea 2 - Submerge a user into a virtual reality world.
 
 Idea 3 - Control RC car or plane with hand movements."
"I think it would be possible to use their hand movement idea and incorporate it into some kind of game, perhaps made in Unity. A possible idea would be to use the Kinect and have the camera track hand movements, and certain hand movements would control the character/plane/car in a simple game."
I think they tried to streak thinking somewhat. Their 3 ideas are - 1. An interactive system with arduino. 2. Make the matrix. 3. A digital physical system that tracks movement to control an RC device.
I think creating a system to track movement and turn that into to controls of an RC device or like a game or somthing would be fun. This has alread been done using the kinect or WII so a new cool way to do it would need to be devised.
"The project of most interest to me would be working to create a therapy program for children with special needs. I know little about this field, but I believe the project would require a great deal of research, and the creation of applicable audio and visuals."
"Given the intent of the assignment the student satisfied all the needs and was very thorough throughout the entire assignment. They had very clear purpose in the entire assignment and were very concise.
 
 In the first idea the student stated the steps that they would go through in order to complete a project in a week. In the second idea the student was very clear on what they would do with the money in the answer and what they would use the money for, and to create a machine for special needs children. The last idea was the student wanting to create a project that records brainwaves."
"It seems that this student detailed how their proposed project for the semester would look in a week, a semester, and in an unspecific amount of time with a billion dollars, rather than proposing three different ideas. The idea seems to be to make hardware, like a robot, that mimics the way the human body looks and works, with the end goal of using it to study the form of the body. The purpose of studying the form is not clear, though with the types of things this student wishes to do, it appears to be useful for general knowledge of the body for anyone that may want to know, whether artistic or health-related."
"This student definitely put a lot of thought into all of their project ideas. For the first idea, she goes into what she would do for the first week, such as planning, budgeting, getting the proper equipment, and meeting with professionals in the field she wishes her project to be in. As for the project itself, I'm not entirely sure what she is aiming to do. She wishes to use neural feedback, as well as feedback from a sensor that gets data from heartbeat. 
 
 
 
 For the second idea, it sounds like she would use the billion dollars to get a bunch of experts (in their respective fields) to help create a sort of therapy for special needs children. She would also have a bunch of equipment to show a progression of their healing/recovery. To me, it sounds like idea 2 is a further expansion of idea 1, which totally clears some stuff up for me.
 
 
 
 For the third idea, it's what has been going on for the previous two. Using data from the brain and the heart to get some sort of outcome. She was unsure of what is realistic for the time given this semester. She didn't propose three different items, but rather one idea that has different outcomes based on her time and money."
So the first answer didn't really say anything that this student could accomplish. It was all very vague and I couldn't figure out what the mobilemousecase project was.
If I knew what this student wanted to work on I would be able to gage what we could do together but I'm not sure what their interests are.
No they did not stretch our thinking. 1. No idea 2. go to Dubai 3. A mobile mouse case.
"I dont really know what the mobile mouse case is but going to Dubai sounds like fun, I had a blast last time I was there."
I like the Dubai Vacation for brainstorming. I feel that you need to have diversity and variety of locations to brainstorm ideas. If theres ever a trip like that count me in! As far as the mobile mouse case idea goes I think you should finish the product. I saw the pitch and the progress in the previous semester and it is an interesting product.
1. The student said that he/she can finish lots of things in a week. But it depended on the resources. 2. Go to Dubai for brainstorming.3. Mobile mouse case! Sounds cool and I hope you can tell more details about it.
I don't know what mobile mouse case is. It sees like you can use your mobile as a mouse. Very interesting. Hope you can do it!
"Some of the ideas were successful, and some weren't. I think their idea 2 was the strongest."
"I really liked the idea 2. We would definitely have to modify it, but I think that within our own phoenix community there are a lot of dichotomies physical appearances."
"The person didn't put too much thought into this one.
 
 The first idea is to create a small digital physical system or installation that looks cool.
 
 The second idea is to connect everyone by creating a internet infrastructure that uses solar/kinetic powered equipment.
 
 The third idea is to simply create a interactive mobile phone app."
I don't really feel like this student stretched the thinking on this assignment. The effort was barely made for this assignment.
I don't know what this student wanted to do so I'm not sure how we could collaborate. A game or installation is very vague.
"The student here is perhaps overly succinct, but seems confident that they can create something worthwhile over the course of the semester. I really like the idea of trying to increase and improve internet connectivity in this country. Other industrialized countries have bandwidth and speed that put us to shame. Replacing all of the old copper lines with fiber would be awesome!"
"If the student goes with creating a game I'd love to do character and concept sketches, storyboards and other visual aspects."
"Idea 1 is to make a graphic that they would paint on their motorcycle, from design to finish. Idea 2 is a movement to get people more active in the US. Idea 3 is app that connects motorcycle enthusiast to each other."
"I feel that all of their ideas could have been expanded upon, and I am not really sure what they had in mind for their second idea. What will this campaign to promote activeness entail? Would their be commercials and public events to help promote activeness? How will people commute to work? Will you design an Arcology and thus eliminate cars altogether? I could feel the sincerity behind their words, but they could have been a little more concrete with this desires, this would have helped in the clarity of their plans.
 
 
 
 Their ideas: 
 
 
 
 One Week: They would either design a decal or paint a mural on their motorcycle.
 
 
 
 Unlimited Time and Money: They wish to create a project that somehow makes people more physically active, they wish for this project to lower to usage of automobiles (and thus leading to less pollution and car related deaths).
 
 
 
 Realistic Semester: A social media app that acts like an internet forum for motorcycle rides and those who just generally love motorcycles."
I really do believe that this student made a sincere effort with this assignment and thinking about what they really want to do in these situations. I think that they really dug deep in thinking what they would want to do based off of what they love to do with their hobbies.
I believe the student put in a lot of effort but I only seem to see two distinct ideas.
My DC concentration is insound so I would be very interested in finding a way to incorporate his sound project.
"I like your enthusiasm, and I would definitely work on a project with you if you brought this kind of attitude into a group project. I too would choose to work on a project that could extend beyond the classroom into helping the outside world with what I have learned within the DC program. Last year I worked on developing a garden that took care of itself with the help of an arduino. However this proved to be a really difficult project for only one person to work on, and was never completed to it's full potential. Therefore if you happen to stumble across an idea that your really feel passionate about, I would be on board to help make it happen."
I would like to start with the idea of the short film and trying to make the world a happier place. I feel that an inspirational short film can help the world or a group of people feel happier. What would we base it off of and what target audience would we push it towards?
Didnt go much in depth on any of the ideas. Pretty vague.
Not sure since I cant seem to figure out what the projects are exactly.
"The student actually made a sincere effort and I believe gave very honest answers, except for the third answer, the student didn't really answer the question or give an idea. The student actually clearly proposes two things, the first idea was about making an inspirational film, the second idea was about researching what makes a human happy without drugs, and to make a device that trains the human brain to think in a positive and non negative way."
"I believe that with the first idea is definitely something that both me and the student could work on. I love films and I love working on films, I think that could definitely be a fun project to work on with someone else, I also believe we could combine elements of the second idea in order to make an inspirational film about how people can be happy and train themselves to think in more positive ways."
"In the first idea, they clearly propose they would make a short film that was inspirational and intriguing to an audience. The only thing about this is, different people feel different emotions. What is intriguing to one person could bore the living hell out of another.
 
 
 
 The second idea is basically saying they want to make people happy! Without the use of any drugs. I fully support this idea.
 
 
 
 There isn't really a third idea, just the student saying that they want to work more with the development side of things."
"The student clearly proposes three separate ideas. For the first, the student's idea is for a short film. While they don't say what the topic will be, they do say that the short would not include explosions or CGI of any sort.
 
 
 
 For the second idea, the student would spend the money on something that could give clean water, or make self driving cars.
 
 
 
 The third idea was to create music."
"I think he/she seem like a visual artist and want to make project is related with visual things. However, it was hard to realize and imagine that is actual project that he/she want to make."
"Idea 1: a short film discussing a topic of interest.
 
 Idea 2: Work to organize and fund the creation of something that could provide clean water to people, or use a similar process for a different issue.
 
 Idea 3: Make music. 
 
 
 
 Though the specifics are a little vague, this student has proposed three ideas and has touched on the details and motivations for them."
"My ideas involve 3D animation, and this student's ideas involve filmmaking, humanitarian organization, and music making.
 
 
 
 So a joint project might could take many forms. Humanitarian concerns can be (and are commonly) addressed in both film and music, and animation can go with both. Maybe it is an animated short film (or at least partially animated), or maybe it is an animated music video to a song or series of songs."
The student wrote vaguely about their own motivations and didn't really provide any ideas for a project.
There aren't any proposed ideas to go off of to make into a project
"1) Vague notion of video editing
 
 2) vague notion of humanitarian efforts
 
 3) Vague notion of creating music.
 
 
 
 Basically, it's pretty vague."
"Idea 1: an interaction based installation that incorporates data from different devices, or robotic display.
 
 Idea 2: work to develop cheaper hardware to benefit future designers and problem-solvers.
 
 Idea 3: A screen made up of a grid of independent, hanging LEDs that move to emulate the reflection on the water in a glass in response to a participant disturbing it."
"My ideas involve animation, and this student's ideas involve a robotic screen that reacts to participants' interactions.
 
 
 
 So a joint project might take the form of an installation that incorporates animations expressed in physical 3D on a robotic screen and viewer interaction."
"The student said they could make some sort of interactive installation, something robotic, or a matrix made of LEDs for the first idea. For the second idea, the student said that instead of one huge project, they would would work on making what we have easier to make and at cheaper costs. This way, more people could make things to solve more problems. For the third idea, I kind of don't understand it, but that's totally on me because it seems like they know what they are talking about. I'm just not sure the final outcome."
"First idea is to develop an interactive light show or system.
 
 The second idea is to find ways to make things that are expensive and time consuming to do now, cheaper and more efficient.
 
 The third idea is to okay with light, water, and perception."
Together we could create some kind of interaction between a physical and digital system.
"The person has a broad range of interests, but I feel that the first two responses are really vague since they talk about what kind of projects they want to work on rather than what projects. Also, what they specified in the first question may be something that would be more than they can handle in one week.
 
 
 
 The third idea is much clearer as they explain their project and its structure and functions. 
 
 
 
 Their three ideas are some project that deals with electrical devices, a cheap hardware to help people, and a mechanical display that moves in fluid-like motion."
"Yes, I think they though deeply about what they could and would do."
There is great expanse on ideas and passions in this idea run. The first idea is to use MAX/MSP to create a sound to light interactive system. The second idea is to create a theatre company that can reproduce the quality of theater performances here in america in countries without significant funding for musicals and theatre performances. The third idea is to create new content for a musical play.
I have created musical compositions for musicals in the past and I would love to be a part of a team to create new content for musicals. It would also be a privilege to find a way to create a good quality theatre performances in other countries.
"I found this classmates ideas interesting, but had difficulty understanding the details, and how their ideas would be accomplished. 
 
 
 
 1. In a week, this classmate would brainstorm and ask key questions about their project. They are most interested in working on a project that connects sound and visuals. 
 
 2. This classmate would like to create an infinite theatre, with an interactive component. The theatre would involve state of the art equipment and take up an unlimited amount of space. 
 
 3. In a semester, this classmate would create an interactive performance scene."
"If I were to work with this classmate I would be most interested in working with him to create an infinite theatre. This idea sounded interesting, but I couldnt quite understand the details or picture the end result. I think this project would involve a great deal of technological and artistic components, but I would need to have a better understanding of the project to know what was needed to physically accomplish it."
"The person has given thought to it, but doesnt describe the ideas quite enough.
 
 The first idea is to create a graphic novel.
 
 The second idea is to create a cartoon from the characters he/she has already created.
 
 The third idea is is to ultimately create a graphic novel."
"1) Graphic novel
 
 2) full cartoon
 
 3) Webcomic leading into graphic novel.
 
 
 
 I would have liked more detail on each idea. None of these are fleshed out enough for my liking."
I can see where this student was heading. So there ideas were thoughtful but just not expressed deeply through the assignment but it is obvious they have passion for this project.
Well they appear to be interested in graphics and rich story line. We could certainly make a roleplaying game out of their novel.
"I think he/she seem like a visual artist, especially 3d animator or interactive media. I can imagine this interactive media system relate with human body. I think 3D animation project is so many potential energy in diverse field like he/she is interested in human psychology."
"I can imagine how his/her project would be great if these three ideas will be developed. To make a go of it, I think he/she has to collaborate with kind of artists such as media installation, sound, or performers. These project ideas are impressive for me and it would be very helpful to make human life better if you develop his/her own system in this semester."
I just have NO idea of what this person is saying.
"The first idea would be to develop a 3d character.
 
 The second idea is to develop a full length animation that is intense and far beyond a few month's capabilities.
 
 The third one is to build upon your skills as an animator and develop something you're proud of."
"We could develop some sort of animation together, as I had done a lot of animation work myself."
The student gave an honest and sincere effort and I believe gave some great answers. The student clearly proposes three ideas in their post. The first idea that the student proposes is essentially making a virtual character (which I think is really cool). The second idea was also a digital animation idea on making a very detailed video game. The last idea was about creating a digitally constructed visual.
If me and this student were assigned to collaborate for the semester I think we could make some very cool digital visuals because this student seems to be very experienced in making digital visuals and I am very artistic and creative and I think I could help this student with some great ideas for visuals that he could actually make on the computer.
Didnt go into much depth besides speaking of animation.
There are three ideas proposed with significant information for me to understand the ideas. The first idea is to create a website or game. The second idea is to create a virtual world with content that mirrors this world. I love the idea of replicating an reliving historical time periods. The third idea is to create a game with intelligent AI that can replicate a human player.
"The larger proposed idea is the creation of an entire virtual world and simulator that would allow for the user to transport themselves anywhere. The second idea is making a video game that centers around AI making it seem as if the computer's AI could be a human. The second idea is basically a smaller version of the first, larger idea."
"The first idea is to do some programming for a video game.
 
 The second idea is to create a very high end video game.
 
 The third idea is to create a less high end video game than in idea 2."
We could make a videogame.
"This student made a very sincere effort and gave some very interesting answers, the student clearly proposed three ideas. The first idea is about showcasing project mapping by using max msp. The second idea is an interactive gaming system for children in hospitals that involves a digital environment. The last idea was creating a new way of playing video games that eliminates ""screen watching""."
"This person has a major interest in projection mapping and interactive environments, this could be relatively easy to work with the appropriate direction and resource management. Even if there is an inclusion of a clothing brand, the proposals are concise and clear."
"The student's first idea is to carve a unique wolf sculpture, idea two is vague but has an endgame of creating an emotionally evocative space for individuals, and lastly idea 3 is to create an installation."
"This is the most well thought out and fully realized pitches for an idea I've read so far. The carving of a wolf sounds like a lot of fun, but also a lot of work. The space installation sounds fascinating, especially the concepts being conveyed by the piece."
I honestly don't know what I'd have to offer this student as far as her project goes. She seems to have her concepts and procedures and work steps pretty thoroughly planned out and there's not much of a visually element that would make my drawing skills necessary.
They made a sincere effort and proposed three ideas. The first idea was to carve a hyper realistic figure of a wolf. The second was to create some sort of environment that creates something eco-friendly. The third was to create a frame to a viewer could see the light in some creative way.
"The person has definitely thought about it, and although the second idea doesn't have an exact project, the idea is there. 
 
 The first idea is to make a sculpture. 
 
 The second idea is to somehow create a way to emotionally connect with other people using technology of some sort. 
 
 The third idea is to create an installation that in short, involves a light and it delivers a message about personal serenity."
"Time travel has always been an interest of mine. That being said, and Alternate Timeline Transportation Device sounds pretty cool. Paradoxes are no fun, so this seems like a much more safe alternative."
"This person shows really fun ideas that may or may not be simple but are interesting to see. The ideas are quite clear with specific features. 
 
 
 
 Their three ideas are simultaneous video game plays, virtual reality device that allows changes in the user's past, and an interactive display with a projection mapping of a mermaid."
The first idea was linking multiple consoles together to be able to play multiple video games from one console. The second idea is to develop an alternate timeline device that would allow users to experience their lives if they made different decisions. The third idea is to develop a virtual mermaid tank in which the mermaid would react dynamically to the environment.
"I think these are some interesting ideas but they are a little over my head.
 
 The first is for some Pokemon game but I'm not too familiar with Pokemon games but i like the idea of projecting older games onto surfaces to give them a new feel.
 
 The second idea is for a alternate timeline which sounds cool but I'm confused how it would be executed.
 
 The last is for an interactive mermaid projection which seems to react to sound and motion."
"The last idea seemed the most doable I would try and focus on scope of the project though.
 
 Would it be life size or smaller?
 
 How would it work in a crowded room?
 
 How many reactions would the mermaid have?"
"All three responses are good ideas, even if idea #2 is currently technologically infeasible. 
 
 
 
 1. A setup that allows a player to play 5 simple games at once as an interesting experience. 
 
 
 
 2. A device that allows users to jump between timelines/ dimensions to try out different actions or choices in life. 
 
 
 
 3. A tank with a projection mapped mermaid inside that reacted to people in a room."
"The ideas are definitely clear as they are and feel well thought-out. The first idea is a stand to hold various electronic devices and chargers on a stand, specifically next to a bed. The second idea is a low-cost wearable device that generates energy through being outdoors or exercising, potentially solving both energy and health problems through motivating people to exercise to charge their electronic devices. The third idea is a game in which the student does most of the artistic work (art, models, environments, etc), and although the exact design of the game is not clear, it appears the student would prefer to work on a shooter of some sort."
"The student made a very good effort on his/her thoughts. All three ideas were detailed and gave the reader a good ideas as to what the student would want accomplished, and possible tools that would be used in order to accomplish their goals.
 
 
 
 Reiteration of ideas:
 
 Idea 1 - Creating a model of a stand to hold all of his electronic devices and chargers by his bed to watch from.
 
 
 
 Idea 2 - Creating wearable technology that is attached to the clothing that gathers solar, body heat, and kinetic energy, as a source of energy that could be stored into a battery.
 
 
 
 Idea 3 - Creating a virtual reality game for the oculus rift, likely a first person shooter, that also uses a suit, fans, and other devices to simulate a more realistic experience."
"The student could use more time to get more specific with the ideas.
 
 The first just states what they would work with not exactly what they would make.
 
 The second is for a system that automatically tended to a garden, I was wondering how this would be done.
 
 The last is for an interactive sculpture which seems interesting."
"I really like the arduino planting idea. I'm not really sure what I add at this point, but the idea is interesting and could really find a use in different businesses around the world."
There are only two kind of vague ideas presented here. The first is a garden that would take care of itself utilizing an Arduino to do the physical work. The second is an interactive sculpture of some sort with no other details.
I would be interested in seeing how far this project would go. I want to see the process of this project campaign and how it is develop. The ministry service is an project that look like it would grow by time not so sure about how big but I would like to contribute someway to see that project grows.
"The ideas of a physical object that can be projected on with animations that can cater to the shape, a cloth or outfit that can be tracked and projected onto for plays and musicals, and a Immersive animation sequence that give the persona sense of being in the POV of the character. You did give this sincere effort and I do like the three of your ideas. I actually love the idea of the clothing that can be tracked and projected onto. It sounds extremely difficult but since your given a billion dollars I'm sure you can accomplish it."
"These projects seem to be well thought out considering the constraints.
 
 The first is for a simple projection mapping on an object.
 
 The second is for a wearable system that communicates with projector some how to trigger different displays.
 
 The last is for a animation that gives the viewer two different perspectives, I think this would be interesting but might be complicated."
"The student I believe did give a sincere and to the point answer with their ideas, the student also clearly proposed three things. The first idea that the student spoke of was mapping animations on to objects and using the object's shape as a way of increasing the visual effects of the animations. The second idea was mapping and tracking clothing on individuals and using it for artistic purposes. The last idea was creating a projection that allows the user to step inside the object being projected on and view the shots from the characters point of view."
With these three ideas I believe that me and this student could work on some cool mapping project that uses the artistic aspects the student spoke of in the third idea to make a really cool visual experience for the viewers.
"Idea number one doesn't seem like much of an idea. It seems like this student is saying they would just spend the week brainstorming. Ideas 2 & 3 both have to do with getting clean water to those around the world who need it most. They also seem like the same idea, just in different words."
"I honestly don't feel like I know enough about the type of thing being proposed, so I have no idea how I would contribute. Although I do think 2 & 3 are worthy of the time and effort."
1. The student said he/she will prepare enough before doing a project. 2. Finding a way to clean water. Like to clean the rain water. 3. To build prototypes about collect water from the atmosphere.
The ideas are great. The steps of making a one-week project are organized. But they are too general so I can't develop more ideas base on that.
"The student put in effort into their ideas but I think more details are needed, as well as possible tools/skills that would be required. In idea 2, I love the idea, but how would you incorporate the solar energy part with this clean water process? In idea 3, I think more information is needed as to what materials/tools/skills would possibly be required for a group of students to create possible prototypes.
 
 
 
 Reiteration of ideas:
 
 Idea 1 - Creation of the outline, draft, visual presentation, write up, and materials required for a possible project.
 
 Idea 2 - Provide clean water to people, and also an air transport system to collect rain water, purify it, and then distribute it, by using solar energy.
 
 Idea 3 - Create prototypes of idea 2 and distribute it with biodegradable containers."
I would definitely partner up on this project since it is about a subject that is very important in life and for society to have clean running water is very important.
Yes this student made a sincere effort to explain their ideas. One of their projects was about scanning magic cards and projecting some type of holographic image. The other was to make a portfolio of all the work they have completed and also a short animation film.
Idea 1 is to make a stop motion video using action figures. Idea 2 is create an interface that would allow magic cards to become 3D mapped on to the field. Idea 3 is create a portfolio of all the artwork and projects they have created.
"I really like the Magic idea, at the moment the streams of Magic Invitationals are rather boring but adding in the spectacle of the 3D rendering could really ramp up the entertainment."
"Three things were pretty clearly proposed. The stop-motion idea is intriguing, as is the holograph-magic card idea (even if it's a little derivative of the yugi-oh anime). And the portfolio development sounds like a really awesome idea."
"I'd love to collaborate on any of these projects, Doing concept sketches of possible characters for the magic cards, or helping to sculpt creatures for the stop-motion animation sound awesome. spending a semester working with other artists and collaborating on creating our individual portfolios and having that input from other artists sounds so beneficial."
This person made a sincere effort and proposed three ideas. The first was to create a stop motion film. The second was to create an interface that scans and 3D prints magic cards. The third was to generate a personal portfolio.
"I like the idea of creating an interface that would create 3D prints of magic cards. Ever since I was little when I use to collect pokemon cards and yugioh cards, I always thought it would be amazing if they had something that I could scan my cards with and that would put them into a game or something. To this day they don't really have anything like that as far as for card games. I know they have Skylanders which sort of does the same thing but for action figures."
"This entry suggests a website that builds on the great commercial success of JK Rowling's series of books and movies. 
 
 The interaction by the reader with the capability of creating their pathway is enticing for people."
"This entry is direct and to the point meeting the need of immediate satisfaction that this world now craves.
 
 It meets the challenge by explaining the site in a clear fashion without emotion yet allows the excitement of the fan world to glimpse through the basic unemotional descriptions."
"Is Pottermore a game or does it interact with the books? In your description, it almost sounds like a game based on a book, and I am not sure that fits the criteria."
"Interesting choice of future book. The strengths of your entry are in the wide variety of uses for blogs as well as examples for them. You have done a lot of research, and it shows. 
 
 The blog meets the challenge of future book by being a never ending, ever-evolving work of text contributed to by many."
Wow! Those are quite the concepts for reading in the future. You have listed a variety and their uses today and in the time to come.
I wonder if Reddit has everything like you state. How is the information validated? Are there actual books there or is it just blogs and just used for information look up? Your guide is slightly confusing to me if you could clarify I would appreciate it.
"Anything Star Wars is an automatic win in my book, and I'm all for retro feels. The physical description of the book and its contents is clear, and taking the reader through the steps of how the images change is helpful to understand what makes this book special."
Fantastic description of the capabilities and (likely endless) possibilities of tumblr. Thorough representation of how you feel tumblr is changing the face of books/lit related media and the features available to bloggers.
"Excellent fact backup and mini-history of audio-blogging/podcasting. Section 3 is well thought out and highlights the pitfalls of a physical printing process, while underscoring the viability of podcasts as a literary medium. Bonus points for the use of ""bourgeois""."
Completed assignment on time.
"What a great example! I had no idea what to write about in my description and think that you chose the perfect media. You've provided a ton of information in your 300 word allotted space. There definitely isn't much ""fluff""- you get down to business from the start. I wish I had a better grasp of what this technology is, as I then think that this would be an extremely informative explanation. Your knowledgable of this type of media is apparent in your description and I learned something new by reading your assignment. 
 
 
 
 You seem confident in your prediction of the future of the book and readers of your assignment cannot deny the contagiousness of your excitement."
"Your summary is great - straightforward and provides the necessary information to understand your idea of the future of books. You chose a very interesting subject matter and I'm excited to check out www.postsecret.com in my free time.
 
 
 
 Your 300 word description is extremely clear and easy to follow. The time that you spent working on this assignment is apparent. You gave a great description of the book itself and allowed your readers to have a grasp of your personal experience with the book and how it changed the way you 
 
 
 
 My favorite line of your description is the following: ""The book is colorful and dark, emotional and boring, fantastic and dull.""
 
 
 
 I love the following line as well: ""What makes this book afuture book is that it doesnt have a single author. It is more like an interactive blog or news feed on an internet social media sight than an actual book."" I wouldn't have linked this book with the ever-popular social media world, but your point is great and so true.
 
 
 
 Overall, I don't think that your assignment needs much revising. You did a great job with the rough draft and looks more like a final draft to me than a rough draft!
 
 
 
 I look forward to reading and critiquing your future assignments for this course!"
"You gave a great summary of the work that you chose to be the future of books. Your quick snippet of a description is clear and purposeful. Your readers have a great grasp on what they are about to read in your description.
 
 
 
 I love that you included a link in your description and have every intention on visiting the website in my free time to learn more about ""Click-Clack the Rattlebag"".
 
 
 
 My favorite sentences of your assignment were the following:'Click-Clack the Rattlebag is a book in name only. Its text is entirely invisible, you see: invisible like ghosts. And thus, aesthetically,Click-Clack is a work of art presented entirely in vocal narrative."" As a reader, you definitely got me interested in the media that you chose to explore and the eerie ""Click-Clack the Rattlebag""."
"Wow! I absolutely love that you included a picture with your summary. It made your assignment come alive and was obviously the first thing that I noticed when I clicked on the title of your work. Not only did you include a picture, but it's a very interesting picture! Just by reading your summary, I got super curious as to what experiencing ""touch"" would be like on pottermore.com. I didn't know such a website existed about the Harry Potter series but am not surprised! I only read a couple of the Harry Potter books (I've never been much into fiction) but am curious and excited to explore the website. It's great that you included the link within your writing.
 
 
 
 Your excitement of this media is apparent in your writing, and definitely string along your readers to read through your whole assignment. I love how you mentioned that the pottermore.com crashed during it's initial release, that you insist that this website is just ""that cool.""
 
 
 
 I love that you realized the following: ""While it is not a replacement for the tome-like books, it brings a flair that is impossible to experience with paper alone."" (My assignment is based on this idea as well.)
 
 
 
 I think my favorite line of your assignment was the following: ""If this website could be neatly bound, pressed, and fitted with a dust jacket, it might be the most perfect book of the future."" You realize that even though the website is super cool, there is still a need for tangible bound books. I agree!"
"I had a hard time finding the strengths of your assignment, as I don't think that you followed the assignment prompt. After reading and rereading your writing, I'm not clear as to what you think the future book will look like. I understand that you've done some family history research and plan on passing it down to your children and your children's children via digital photography and writing, though I have no idea about what you think the future of books will be.
 
 
 
 Please see my constructive criticism below, as I think that your rough draft needs some major rewriting."
"Your summary isn't very clear. My first suggestion would be to rewrite this portion of the assignment and be straightforward, not leaving anything to be guessed or assumed. The purpose of a summary is to tell the reader exactly what they are about to read, not to leave them wondering what your subject matter is and what they're about to get involved with.
 
 
 
 Of the five assignments I've read, yours needs the most amount of revision in my opinion. I'm not exactly sure how to approach your writing, as I kind of think the whole thing needs to be rewritten. The assignment was to decide on what the future of the book will be and give a 300 word explanation of it, followed by why you think that society is leaning in the direction of your chosen mode of literary media. To me, your assignment just seems to tell of how you've done some research on your family history. Perhaps you should read through the assignment prompt again, as I think that you may have been confused as to what we were supposed to write about. Maybe I'm so wrong and I've completed the assignment incorrectly, but mine follows the same guidelines as the other four I've just critiqued.
 
 
 
 I hope you don't find my response as rude, would just rather tell it to you straight as you have an opportunity to fix your assignment before you turn in the final draft - that's a good thing!"
"The entry specifically points to the book's uniqueness, in that it is not necessarily just an e-book or a website; it is her brand. This meets the assignment's challenge by being both specific and creative by finding a book that is very atypical."
"The future factor explanation is very well done. I definitely want to find something like this, as I'm sure most people who enjoy faster processing would. By appealing to the demand of the people, this entry meets the challenge, though it does not offer a way for people to actually find such a book."
"This is highly imaginative and definitely something that would be a fun, interactive experience for any reader. It meets the challenge by turning a book into a video game, something that is surely being worked on by the creators of e-books and web-books."
"Using a PostSecret book is a great choice. It is compiled of thousands of people's work, making it a unique, collaborative project (that, somehow, still keeps its secrets). The explanation of the future factor is spot on: it is a blog in a book, and surely a medium that will evolve into something great."
"Perhaps in the future factor section, the author could make a solid case for why exactly I should go out and buy it. While obviously I'm interested, what specifically makes this book extra appealing, and why?"
"The book promoted truly does break down barriers of storytelling, as the author states. It is a wonderful example of the future book, and giving many examples of its strengths makes the entry very convincing. Additionally, the author's telling is both engaging and compelling."
"I really like how you pointed out, in the beginning of your explanation, that you do not think books will ever die. I think this is important because, it keeps in mind that yes, although documentary film is becoming an extremely popular way for information to be transferred, it is not going to replace the traditional method of exchanging information. It also allows for books to remain special and sacred, and to stay an outlet for those who want to ˜disappear into their own world. This being said, you make an excellent point in stating that film is very relatable as it is easy to SEE another individual, and thus experience aspects of their lives with them. I also think you did a very good job explaining the film and in explaining the intrigue and the value in its genre as a documentary."
"I agree with you that sites such as tumblr are growing to be exponentially popular. In addition to liking and reblogging photos, users can reblog and critique or praise an individual's work, which includes but is not limited to: art,photography, music, poetry, and short stories. Because there is potential for re-blogging content, if an individual posts exceptional work, their work is likely to become extremely popular on the site, which can be a very good thing for the original poster. I think that many people who use tumblr use the site for the exact purpose of discovering and connecting to other people's posts, opinions, and self-created work."
"The problem I see with tumblr is that there is no citation, and it is very easy to 'steal' one's work. In the tumblr guidelines, it explicitly states that all content you post is liable to be viewed and re-used by other people. This means someone can re-blog a story or poem you write, and totally trash it, or even edit it themselves. While this is wrong and most individuals wouldn't do this, there is nothing in the tumblr guidelines stating that this is wrong, and tumblr staff cannot be held responsible for if an OP is not given credit for a 'stolen' picture or post. In the future, do you think that there could be an add-on to tumblr that instates a rule or a policy that enables an original poster to always receive credit for their work? If books are moving to be completely online, would not this be necessary on a site like tumblr, if an author wanted to maintain their credibility and their autonomy as the original writer of a work?
 
 Also, another problem I see is that, while there is SO MUCH creativity possible on tumblr, there is not really a place for those who want to become involved in a story to go. If I wanted to read an entire, thousand page book, or even a book series, I would not go on tumblr to do it. It just isn't possible to read so much information on a post. In addition, an author cannot make any profit, or gain any credit other than recognition from writing a book - so if tumblr were to be the future of books, there would be no way for a writer to make a living. Do you think that, in the future, it would be again possible to add on to the site a place for writers of long novels / book series? In this add-on, could it be included that one would have to purchase the author's work before being able to view it and reblog it? This way they are still following the 'tumblr way' and re-blogging work, but they are also honoring an author's time and energy, and cannot simply view it / re-blog without giving at least some form of tribute. This would also make it a lot less possible for someone to 'edit' or 'remove' the OP's part in the post, and it would also still allow for a re-blogger to leave commentary - just, the work wouldn't be free, as books are not free. 
 
 Just a thought! I think the idea of tumblr being the future of books is genius!"
"I think you did an excellent job of building up this book. You made the book seem very intriguing, exciting, and above all, futuristic. I have no idea how you managed to include pictures, but the pictures certainly did an amazing job of enhancing the work and proving your overall point. Through viewing the photos alone, and without reading any of your text, I got the feel that this book is incredibly different than other 'traditional' books, and in this I think you absolutely met the challenge of this assignment. I think that, in your final draft, your photos will do an outstanding job at proving your point. In addition to this, your writing was well-thought out, properly organized, and succeeded in dynamically building up the book you chose. Great work!"
"I honestly do not believe you need to embellish upon your original draft before it is finalized; your work was clear, concise, and to the point, as well as implanting an interest and an intrigue in not only the work you described, but also in a genre of books that follows the style of your chosen work. I wouldn't change anything to this draft, so good job!"
"I do agree that websites such as Reddit are not only very popular now, but will also continue to be popular in the future. People want a way to interact with one another, and also want to find individuals who share certain interests. As you said, it is not just text that is used on Reddit, but also pictures. In addition, people can also bring in other information to help others out or to just share interesting experiences, and I think that people of todays generations and in future generations really enjoy that autonomy in writing and reading."
"I believe that this description of the Role-Playing book was sufficient in answering the prompt questions. In addition, the OP made the Role Playing book seem exciting, challenging, and subjective to one's decisions and preferences, which many individuals will most certainly enjoy. The book is also not limited, it seems, to a physical, hand-held book, and can also be read and 'played' on e-devices, making it accessible from many different locations and in many different ways. The reader will be in control of the outcome of the ending, which can be a delightful experience for many individuals who prefer this type of book."
"The article is well-written and accurately describes the subject matter and how it can be seen in the future of the book, particularly in the realm of fan-author interactions."
"The links are very helpful for anyone who isn't immediately familiar with the app, and the Future Factor of the material is stated very clearly."
"The article is very well written and gives the reader a good understanding of the nature of the Pottermore website. Adding the detail about the site crashing on launch is also a great way to show that it's not just the author who feels positive about this sort of continuation of printed works in the digital realm, as is comparing it to other popular social media."
"The author does an excellent job of both describing the material, making it sound almost irresistible to readers, and explaining why this book exemplifies how technology will shape the future of the book. Providing the link to the material in question is also quite nice."
"The article is very well-rounded and addresses many valid points about blogs and how they reflect the changing nature of writing online, publishing online, and the closer interactions between reader and writer."
"""Annarasumanara"" is a Korean variation on the many Japanese web-based, comic-book style stories that grew out of the Manga and Anime and comics of a few decades ago and that have now become rendered as graphically enhanced software that can be displayed on computer screens. The strength of this entry is that it does demonstrate an important aspect of the continuing evolution of books by showing us an example of one segment of the ""reading pool"" that is now making the transition from print to digital format."
"This is quite an interesting interpretation of the intent of this assignment. Using DNA testing as a way to build a historical thread that can possibly reveal long-lost relatives from the past, or perhaps uncover historical facts about people that might help to strengthen filial bonds (or not!) certainly identifies an application of a current technology (genetic and genome analysis) that can be used in a very positive way. And the translation of the data collected into electronic formats will make it more likely that information converted from printed and pictorial media will be stored in a centralized place, with a reasonably high chance surviving for a very long time. You seem to be agreeing, then, that the eventual transformation of knowledge and information, including books, from the printed formats of today to more digitized forms is not only occurring, but will continue to happen until one day nearly all of our reading interactions will take place through a human-machine, electronic interface."
"This is a very good example of a current technology that is moving us closer to a time when written information is created, edited, refined, developed, critiqued, and stored in an Internet-based, 'cloud-like' environment. In a direction divergent from social-networking websites such as Facebook -- and as the author of this entry has explained -- Tumblr demonstrates one of the ways in which our book and information technology is changing from one based on printed materials to one based in a digital universe. Human interactions here are and will rely on man-machine interfaces that may eventually eliminate the need for printed copies of nearly everything. This example also welcomes wild speculation about the way humans will be exchanging information in the future!"
"Kali's selection of ""Night Film"" for her entry for the field guide is presented very well and the embedded images provide visuals that help the reader understand the unusual characteristics of this book. Although scores of other authors have incorporated illustrations, graphs, images, codes, and other visual devices to enhance the reader's experience in 'living' the story, the merging of information that provides the reader with links and other interfaces to the Internet, the importance this additional information has to the story lines and the need to download an external decoder, while possibly annoying to some readers, is in itself an example of how the current technology of the book is using the wonders of the digital age in incorporating some of its interfaces as an integral part of the book."
"Kali's obvious skill at presenting ideas and information -- as her adeptness in articulating opinions in our discussion posts has already been demonstrated -- will be an advantage as she further develops the idea she has proposed in this first draft of her field guide. Hopefully, she will also include some thoughts on how the techniques used by Pessl in ""Night Film"" will evolve as the technologies for interacting with data and ideas (particularly 3-dimensional) progress to the point in which readers feel more like travelers through a parallel universe -- feeling the same sensations experienced by characters in the story -- than outsiders looking in."
"This is another good example of a book that uses current digital technology to enhance a reader's interactive experience (in this case, a children's book designed to be read on an iPad using iBooks as the e-reading application. Although printed books have provided an excellent medium to display vivid illustrations and bright colors for children, it is not until books began to be digitized and designed to be read on electronic reading devices that animations, voices, and movement -- all of which greatly enhance a child's interaction with a story -- that features such as the author has described are now possible. Selecting a children's book in demonstrating possible directions for the future of books provides ample room to speculate on what may be in the realm of possibility within the next decade and, indeed, within the next century."
It does show how things we did in the past are now improved or changed as a result of technological advances. I clearly understand the point the author is making and the writing is clearly thought-out.
"The field guide attempts to show the ability that technology has to instantly document our lives and save that documentation forever, without fear of it being lost due to some physical destruction. The problem is we spend most of the field guide learning about the authors time his/her brother uploaded their DNA online in order to map back potential members of their gene pool. While this is interesting it seems to fall short of the assigned task of finding a (a real book, object, publication, real or virtual thing), not something made up."
The field guide closely follows the prompt and finds a new type of way to engage with books through some sort of future or new technology. The guide explains the process of emerging existing texts into a more immersive reality and has made me want to download the app on mu iPhone.
"In the future factor section, the field guide slips away from the pragmatic approach taken in the description and delves into an area of more idealizing than explaining this thing in the desired technical manner."
"Kudos for using futuristic implementations into the field guide, like the hyperlink to News from Gardenia's Unbound site and the picture. The Field Guide does well to sell its audience on News from Gardenia which is a book about the possibility of a utopian future. The author of the guide accurately and with concise but important detail, gives an accurate description of the thing they are writing on."
"Though Unbound, the crowdsourcing platform for book publishing is really the futuristic aspect of the guide we only hear about it once we get to the last section. Instead of describing News from Gardenia so thoroughly we should be getting a description of how Unbound will change the future of text."
The field guide describes Reddit very well and points out all the aspects of Reddit that make it something that answers the prompt's questions. The field guide creates even for someone who knows nothing about Reddit a well thought out description enabling them to use the site.
"While the Field Guide explains Reddit very well and enables the user of the guide to navigate the site with ease, its claims that Reddit is the future of books is a bit short sighted. While Reddit may be the future of DIY, self-help and information/resource based books, it will have a hard time treading in the rivers of fiction. Fiction is a huge aspect of books and text still and the Reddit community and the way the site is constructed would struggle in attempting to improve the fiction universe."
The selected thing from which the Field Guide is created follows the prompt perfectly. The description in the field guide explains what has changed in the books adaptation and these changes are a result in new technologies and advancements made.
"The technologies described definitely seem to provide a more immersive experience for the reader. Especially ""Alice,"" with its ability to provide a previously unheard of level of interactivity with the story itself. The selections point toward an emerging technology meant to work with the existing book itself to make it something new. It meets the challenges of the assignment by detailing how these products enhance the reading experience in a variety of ways (social, interactive, and reviews). It also hints toward how these technologies might be expanded upon in the future, to further change the reading experience."
"This entry very effectively describes the ergodic text, ""House of Leaves,"" and how it utilizes unorthodox methods of story-telling to give voice to several characters. The features detailed make the prospect of reading a text of such innovative design very enticing. It is representative of how certain authors are now bushing the limitations of the traditional book to tell stories in a way few could have previously imagined."
"I do not believe this entry falls short. It effectively achieves its goal of describing this ergodic text and what books could look like in the future. I do, however, disagree that this text and those like it show the way forward for the book. I believe they are quite powerful as a novelty, as I believe printed books will become in the future. However, I don't believe they will go further than that and become an industry standard. It would be much more difficult for new authors overall to consistently produce multilayered content as a standard format. It would also get laborious for the reader and the format would no longer be unique. Ergodic literature can range from multilayered storytelling to works of art that use words as their medium. In order to remain as impressive as they are, they rely partially on the fact that the are so different from the traditional book. Additionally, while texts like these seem as though they would have to be produced as a physical book, that is not necessarily true either. A good example would be ""S."", by J.J. Abrams and Doug Dorst, as it is an ergodic text that is also available as an ebook and an audiobook."
"This sounds like an amazing companion to one of the, if not the, most popular book series' in history. The Harry Potter series enjoyed immense popularity before it ever graced a movie screen. There are few modern series' that have managed to hold the public attention in such large numbers for seven books and eight film adaptations. I can only imagine how immersive and how much fun this site would be for a Harry Potter fan. I think this description really gives the reader a sense of the level of content on the site. As well as several examples of the interesting and creative content they can expect to find when they visit it. For an fan, after reading that description, I can only imagine that their next stop would be Pottermore.com."
"Fair warning: This is my second review about this site. I feel this description did a very good job of highlighting the social features of the site and the additional literary content, in the form of fan fiction and the small additions from Rowling, which would definitely be a draw for any die hard Harry Potter fan. Combined with the continual development of additional story content in the games and the ability to stay in contact with J.K. Rowling herself. It definitely appears that Pottermore.com would be the number one place to go to immerse one's self in the Harry Potter universe."
"There is no clear connection to the idea that this is an evolution of the book, or something bound to replace the book. It is a website. A very in-depth site with many features, but it is still not a place where on can go and read the seven official Harry Potter texts or an innovation that delivers those stories in another way but in the same depth. It is a great resource for fans, but it is still reliant on the existence of the books, in basically their traditional form, one which to build this universe."
I believe you've made a strong point here about the similarity between documentary and informational text. There is a natural connection in the way that the information is delivered. Video in a how-to or documentary style may very well replace their textbook or informational text counterparts in the future. This is one of the few types of books I believe is on the way out.
"I think the author of this entry effectively argued their point I do not have any criticism, other than that the ""future factor"" section was definitely over 150 characters."
"This entry goes in depth to explore how podcasts offer the same experience of reading a book but with the added benefit of being able to multi-task. It effectively explains what a podcast is, who uses them, and why they are important. It also uses several very specific examples to strengthen its assertions."
"This is an extremely well-written entry, with enough excellent description to make anybody want to read (or here, listen to) this story. It highlights a very relevant piece, one which blends the custom of stories with the ""second orality"" we are focusing on. The writer of this entry appeals to ""the illiterate and the bibliobibuli alike,"" stating the advantages of such a form of literature in the modern world. A great entry!"
"I've read and reread this entry trying to find something to suggest an improvement on, and I can't find it. This is a great entry and I think it accomplished everything it was meant to."
This is a very interesting take on the future of the book -- the focus on an interactive future is exciting. I think this entry presents an excellent argument for the futuristic digitalization of literature. It effectively describes the benefits of such technology and why it is an important option for our literary future.
"This entry wonderfully blends the arts of printed books and digital media, must like the subject itself. It is clear that the writer supports the idea of digital media as an enhancer of printed text, rather than a complete replacement, which is something I completely relate to. This entry effectively describes the content of the story without being over-revealing, and it describes the ways in which the story is a glimpse into the future of literature."
I think this entry does a great job of answering each of the questions and meeting the requirements of the assignment. I am absolutely inspired as a reader to experience this work for myself.
"I think this entry very effectively describes what makes ""Annarasumanara"" different from other e-texts, and therefore a ""future"" book rather than one we already know. The author picks out a specific characteristic of this web comic (the noticeably different format and disregard to the uniformity consistent with other web comics) to distinguish it from others and propose it as a futuristic text. It also gives readers an idea of what the web comic is about, and makes us curious to know more about the characters and story line."
"Great choice of film! I love the documentary Babies, and I think you hit upon its main unique strength here in a very eloquent way. Rather than use text at all to communicate its message, it relies specifically on non-verbal cues and images throughout the film. I really like how you mention that if you glance away for a moment, you can miss a part of the story, as that is very true for that film and for so many social cues which are non-verbal. I think this brings up all sorts of great questions, because if this film is a sort of future book it seems more a type of oral culture than literary culture. Indeed, it would seem that almost all documentary films are, in a way, more a throwback to an oral culture than literary culture. I think you've hit on an interesting idea here."
"Wow, this is definitely a double-future dose. Literally future-esque, as in its subject matter, and then the figuratively future-esque of the assignment, with the Unbound Publishing. I'm a big reader and I hadn't heard of Unbound, so very cool!
 
 
 
 I love your description of the book, as you point out right away what makes the subject matter of the book unique--the isn't the same old dystopian novel, but a utopian novel where we aren't all subject to the same old gloom and doom. You point out the book's effects, that it has the ability to inspire people to make a better world, which I think is also important to make people want to run out and grab it. They know what its about, but what is it going to make them feel? So in several ways, you've found a very unique book. 
 
 
 
 I also appreciate that you are concise. In English classes I think we tend towards fancy language without saying a lot, and I think you use direct language here which conveys your message with the clarity the assignment wanted, something I know I had a hard time doing myself."
"Wow, the technologies I've critiqued thus far are crazy. I had no idea the ""future"" of the book was so advanced!
 
 
 
 This is a great choice of technology to feature, as it is obviously right on the pulse of the future.
 
 
 
 I like how you mention the possibilities with children quite a bit, as I think that is important, I know many children who already use iPads as reading tools and I can definitely see this as a possibility in the future.
 
 
 
 You also managed to explain everything in an eloquent way, there weren't any grammar errors in your writing that I could find, so great job on that as you are talking about some complicated tech topics here."
"The entry strengths are good because it explains how The secret lives of Men and Women can attract to people who want rather read from the internet. It challenges the assignment because it provides reasoning on why this would be the future book, such as how people adapt to social media and how this future book can relate to it."
The entry strengths are the detail explanation about the book. It meets the challenge of the assignment because it discuss and explains how this book can be a future book.
"I think that the entry falls short in the reader not understanding the reason this book can be the future book, It give the reader many explanation about but not very well convincing. I think that it needs to be more convincing as to why this can be a future cook."
The reader gets a full understanding of what is being describe to be the future book. It meets the challenge of the assignment because it is explained and gives a good knowledge about why the role playing game and choose your own adventure game can be the future book.
I really think this post was good because it provided the book information in details and that it was an ebook. It met the challenge of the assignment because their was enough information to convince the reader about the future book and why it could be.
The strengths can be found in that there was a lot of good detail information to why the digital book is the future. It met the challenge of the assignment in proving reasons as to how the digital books will be the future books due to modern technology.
The author certainly supports that podcasts are a way forward for creative works. There are a number of outside sources within the Field Guide that support the idea that podcasts and recorded audio work in general could surpass the written word as a way to consume both fiction and non-fiction.
"The author does an excellent job in summarizing the appeal of the novel itself. In addition, the way the book is created, with crowdsourced financing and increased interaction between audience and author, is a compelling way forward for future publications."
"The author does an excellent job at describing the uniqueness of the work itself, as well as the visual style of the art. The ability to alter or eliminate the restrictions of the printed page is well-explained in how the work takes advantage of the lack of limitation in electronic form."
"This field guide entry does an excellent job in explaining Tumblr and how it can be used by authors and artists to distribute their craft. It also demonstrates how this can be effective in a changing electronic landscape, incorporating both multiple forms of media and reader-response into an ongoing product."
"The author does an excellent job focusing on a single work and expanding on the method that work uses in order to demonstrate how this can be used for a variety of works. Each aspect of the expanded website is well-explained and clear, and it's easy to see how this is a useful tool to expand the world of the novel."
"I love the way you portrayed the ongoing relationship a blog can establish between author and reader in theFuture Factor section and how it differs from that of a novel. You did a great job in your description as well, and made a compelling case as to why a blog can be considered afuture book."
"You did an excellent job with this assignment. Your descriptions were very clear and you made a compelling case as to why Pottermore is afuture book. I had never heard of it and you made me want to go check it out myself. You have a great tone to your writing that made your entry enjoyable to read. I love your last line and the idea of technology as a tool tofeed the fans, great imagery (and very accurate I believe). Fans are always hungry for more and are constantly searching for new ways to feed that hunger. Technology offers a great way for fans to connect with the author, as well as other people who have the same interests."
"I loved your entry! It was thoughtful and very creative. You have a great tone that makes your writing enjoyable to read. I loved the way you described the aesthetics of the book, invisible like a ghost. I also liked that you included Gaimans Halloween gift-giving tradition. That history gives the work more solidity. You did a great job in your description and made me want to go download it immediately. You also made a compelling case as to why this is aFuture Book. 
 
 Bibliobibuli is a great word by the way, I actually had to look that one up :)"
This was a great entry. Your description was excellent and by far your greatest strength in this assignment. It was very detailed and I could clearly imagine the book in my head.
"This was certainly the most creative idea I've read. The idea that we are all stories is one that I firmly believe. It's a great concept. I like the way you portrayed all the footprints we are creating through photographs, videos, facebook, twitter, instagram, etc. Our great grandchildren will have a far more accurate account of our story than we have of our own great grandparents. What I also like about this concept is that our stories never really end. Our story is part of our parents' story and our friends' stories and many other stories that are constantly overlapping and weaving together throughout the years."
"This entry provides a detailed account of the author's ""future"" book."
"This entry was very interesting, particularly for those who are interested in science fiction novels. The description of the book's synopsis is what makes it really captivating. The student started their description with a question bringing the reader in as if we were reading the back cover of the book."
"It was a very good entry with very little I can find wrong. The future factor is well described and I feel I have a grasp on what Unbound is all about. Additionally, the student explained why this way of writing publishing could be popular in the future. The student also gave us a taste of what his/her full field entry will look like with a clear and well lit picture. I suppose if I wanted to see anything more, it would be more about the history/inspiration of the book."
"This entry is actually very realistic and makes a convincing argument for the popularity of orality over reading with examples of existing podcasts and other media today. Similarly, although the future factor contains a lot of hypotheses there seems to be enough realism to make it believable such the expense of printing and digital."
"The students gives a wonderfully detailed description of his/her future book. The format was thoroughly explained enough for me to understand what I would be getting into without the student actually giving away the story. The student also made a great point in their future factor about how creative format books such as ""House of Leaves"" would not be able to be e-books or digitized."
The student has provided sufficient background for his/her future book as well as a convincing and believable argument as to why the format for such a book will become even more popular.
"The part about ""Alice"" met the challenge of the Assignment. I liked the idea of being in Hogwarts and walking around and looking at notes! Maybe the author could set these scenarios up in such a way that the curious are rewarded."
A very spirited campaign for the blog! I could see how reading a blog could approximate the book-reading experience for you.
Description was strong. Many good points and examples. I listen to podcasts often while working myself.
"Future factor was weak. Reference to Konstantinou seemed only tangentially related. You seems do be saying podcasts are the future because publishing might be shut down...? Are you saying in the future, there will be no blogs? If there is no internet, how are the podcasts disseminated? I'm sorry, I was confused by this."
"Future Factor was strong, but it did not match Summary and Description. Future Factor section had a great idea for future book format and good points about how fast technology is moving."
This was a great example of a story in a new-ish format. It made me interested in seeing and reading the comic!
"Not sure how this is the future if it is now...? Also, can it be read on a phone or is size sometimes still a consideration for this format?"
I think the subject of the field guide was well chosen. This is an interesting competitor in a very new and exciting space. You did a great job of conveying the sense of newness and excitement for the 3 different programs. I agree that interacting with books in the future could be heading in this direction.
This entry highlights a very recent innovation. The case for this being futuristic is easy to make. I don't think it is a stretch to anticipate an increase in supporting content for novels. I agree that we will very likely see more of this type of interactive website in the future.
"This entry provides a strong sense of what is means to be a future-ready book. I agree with the sentiment that readers in the future will want increased speed, technology, and convenience. The ebook or hybrid book definitely fits the speed, technology, and convenient requirement nicely."
"I love the connection to video games. Video games are growing in such a huge way that it would be easy to conceive of a distant future where movies, TV, and even literature take inspiration from them. This is a very fun and futuristic vision."
Excellent future factor! I have a few friends that hate reading and have switched exclusively to audio books(where possible). I have yet to listen to one but it is clear that this type of format is already catching on. Your particular entry sounds like an improvement on the traditional audio book. Good job.
"This entry focused on the Ideo, a really innovative technology. This entry delves into the specifics of Ideo, and the different concepts that they have developed. It is well-written, and a thoughtful post. It meets the challenges of the assignment by examining such an innovative concept."
"I really enjoyed this entry's selection for the assignment. It was innovative and interesting. The author takes a unique perspective by examining the children's book. As children thrive on constant stimulation, electronic devices are great for kids."
"This entry does an excellent job at incorporating images and text. The author clearly thought about this assignment, and the work is very well-written. The author selected an unique text, and successfully described the book's elements."
"This entry's strength lie in the last section. The production of the book is what makes it futuristic, and it is a coincident that the book also happens to be about the future. The author was also able to include an image, which makes the post stronger. The description section was written very creatively and sounded like something you would read off the back of the book."
"This entry's strength is in thinking outside of the box. I would have never examined a Post Secret book in a futuristic manner, but I understand the logic behind it after reading this entry. This author has a detailed explanation of postsecret.com that aides in understanding the concept. Overall, it is well-written."
This entry clearly defines the Pottermore website and its attributes as an extension of the Rowling series of books. It definitely could be viewed as a futuristic technological leap for books especially this type of story that has an epic quality too it and multiple books contained within a single story line.
The author clearly describes the book in great detail as far as its physical look and appearance and gives a good comparison helping the audience understand somewhat what scanimation is.
"I love how the author of the entry describes all the parts of the book that make it futuristic. It sounds like the book using the internet in a major way to tell the story and this integration of literature and internet technology definitely speaks to a the future direction of books. It sounds like a great read, I'll have to check out."
The author of this entry perhaps goes to far in re-telling the entire plot of the book. The entry is incredibly long and quite possibly far over the 500 word limit. A tighter description of the futuristic qualities of the book and a lot less plot telling would make the entry more successful as a field study guide. Right now it reads more like a book report.
"This entry does a great job of capturing the futuristic essence of ""The House of Leaves."" There is great descriptions and focus on the formatting of the text in the story. This appears to be the greatest example of the book's author's forward and futuristic thinking. This too, sounds like a great read."
There really isn't much to critique in the negative of this entry.
This entry doesn't describe an actual book. It merely covers the idea of what a successful future book would look like. The assignment was to find a book that speaks towards the future and describe it's merits as a future book. This entry doesn't do this at all.
"The strength in this entry is definitely the hard fact that this concept and company are brand new to most of us reading the entry. The description and use of persuasive language in the description was exceptional. It made me want to watch the video for a second time.
 
 This meets the challenge of the assignment because it is simply an actual attempt at a company predicting the trajectory of where the future of the book will be."
The problem that had me questioning whether it would work as an entry was the fact that two of the three products were things that surrounded and enhanced the use of a book or ebook. I might focus on the last company(?) that actually altered the way we would read books.
"The strength in this entry is the third section which explains the ""future factor"". While the actual product might not interest me completely, the explanation as to how it represents how we as readers can interact with a story in different ways made me want to check this story out to at least experience the different mediums. 
 
 This entry meets the challenge of the assignment because it provides us with an actual product that is being used by authors and readers today, but is only a glimpse into what is possible in this new technology."
There are a few grammatical errors in the entry that caused me to have to reread the sentence.
"The strength of this entry is the writers passion for reddit. The writer seems very invested in this particular website, and states very vehemently that this site is already replacing books. 
 
 The entry meets the challenge because it is one of the specified examples in the assignment description."
"This entry's strength is it's description of the technology. While this is the second entry to describe a technology that interacts with books in the form of an app, it explains the technology in a way that I am able to picture in my mind.
 
 This meets the challenge of the assignment because it introduces the readers to a new way to interact with printed books."
"The strengths are definitely the added images. This is something that I forgot about in my assignment, and none of the other reviews that I'm doing are for entries that include pictures at all. I think that this entry did an excellent job enticing me to read the book. I agree that Pessl's ""Night Film"" can be described as a future book because of the extrasensory details that the book includes in order to involve the reader in the story.
 
 
 
 I think it meets the challenge of the assignment because it has expertly addressed every aspect of the project and made me want to go out and read this book!"
"I would have been interested to read an entry about something other than the style of books that we've already been reading in class, which is what I felt this entry felt like. I don't really have anything else to suggest, I think this article was done really well and its the best one that I reviewed!"
"This entry meets the challenge of the assignment because I believe that it is a representation of a future book, albeit for personal reasons only."
"I think that the author of this entry was feeling very strong about the book that s/he chose. This allowed for a more passionate feeling about the book which makes the reader of this entry want to read the book and to see the accompanying film and apps! I think its really cool that this book has other platforms that go along with it aside from just different pictures like we saw in ""A Dodo at Oxford"". This ties the book to more recent modes of media which I found very interesting."
I think the subject of this entry is very interesting and is something that I would enjoy taking a look at. Its also a reference to some iconic pop culture which I think will still be relevant in the future. I think this meets the challenge of the assignment because it ties together the past and the future in a way that I think could be relevant for anyone.
"This entry is about documentaries with a primary focus on the ""Babies"" documentary film. I liked this entry because I felt like it gave a different spin on the project while still meeting the assignment. This is definitely an example of the future of the book. I could see people in the future choosing to watch documentaries to learn about things instead of reading books. As it is, things like furniture and special dog collars already come with DVDs to show you how to use them correctly."
"I really enjoyed the description of how Gaiman reads the script of the book. I thought the summary was straight and to the point as it should have been - easy to understand and immediately know what I was going to read about. As someone familiar with Gaiman's style, but who has not listened to this book, the description of his ""acting"" skills piqued my interested in the project and made me go and physically look up the project online after I finished reading the entry, so I feel that that aspect of the description was well done. It was also helpful to find out a bit of the background of the book, which unlike many other stories is very unique. (which was also an aspect of the assignment, just as the voice of the piece and attempting to motivate people to go and read the piece was). I also felt that the last line of the future section was particularly effective and was a lovely way to end the section by tying in themes of the Gaiman's pieces."
"I think the piece is off to a very good start, in general I think there are just a few places that could be expanded upon with some greater detail. As the author mentions the presentation of the book is unique as an audio book, so in addition the description of Gaiman's voice as the author has done which is very well done, the argument would benefit from describing how that unique experience of being read to instead of reading; not being separated from the author by your own voice, pacing, and tone of reading, or physical page, but instead almost having a ""tangible"" connection to the author and the authors voice changes the reading experience as only an audio book can. Doing so would help to further drive home the point that audio books are a entirely unique experience. I would have also like to have a scene a little bit of a deeper analysis on how audio books could expand reading in the future - again, drive home the point that this format can uniquely change the reading experience over other mediums, not just save time as the author rightfully mentioned."
"I specifically thought the description that focused on the Alice program was direct, easy to follow and clearly showed how the program furthered the reading experience through an immersive experience for the reader - it was the most effective and impactful description and really showed how books can incorporate future technology in order to evolve."
"I greatly appreciated the use of senses to describe the unique elements of the website in the description section - I also wrote about Pottermore and that was not something I had thought about including in my own description but it really helped to sell the complete atmosphere the site provides not just in content but all the way to its attention to ambiance, which is something unique to web and audio formats that can not be included in the book. The sensory details helped set the stage for the following descriptions of the types of activities users can participate in on the site, helping to show how immersive and expansive the site is and truly showing how individual it is. The summary is also very clear and direct, the reader knows exactly what the entry will be about and what to expect in the following sections."
"I thought the description of just what makes Pottermore a future book was well crafted and straight to the point. Not only did it show how it represents something new in the formatting and use of books by explaining the interactive websites use as a digital extension of the printed world to be used in conjunction with the books, but it mentioned why this was successful - people depend upon technology. In the other posts I have read, not many authors focused on why their type of book was sustainable and successful for the future of books; this post did in an well though out sentence. Such an explanation helps to solidify the potential of this type of medium and why it could feasibly be incorporated into other books and other genres as people become more and more familiar with and dependent upon technology."
"I thought the focus on the emotional reaction of the reader based on the text was intriguing and a very interesting way to show readers that the future of the books does not necessarily have to involve technology in a traditional way. The descriptions of the multiple formats and uses of texts (and their purposes) truly showed not only the versatility of font and format, but its importance, and just how deeply the presentation of words in a story can effect the readers emotional well being or reflect the state of the character or the world of the book in a visceral way. The idea that the technological advances of books does not have to mean their conversion to ebooks or their forced incorporation of technology was interesting and well presented."
The strength of your rough draft is that you explained the usages of a blog very thoroughly and what a blog encompasses.
"The strength of your draft are that you clearly describe the journey of Emily C. chronologically detailing her story as a vegan, among other aspects of that such as including recipes. I also found it strong that you mentioned howe-books are the wave of the future and the items that are now extinct that once captured memories."
The strength of your article is that you clearly described the benefits of a hybrid book and contrasted it with an actual book to where I could understand why you would prefer a hybrid book.
"Your strength in your rough draft was that you kept my interest and I desired to look up the site that you cited. Everything flowed very well and I think this is an exciting way to jump off from a book into the technology aspect, as not everyone has a computer, but if they desire to go farther than a book, they have the option to do so. Our discussion boards are very similar, as gaining insight from each other aids in our learning and understanding. You taught me something with this, as I did not know it even existed, my mother still goes to book clubs at the local library, and this would definitely prove more convenient."
"I did not find any weaknesses in your paper, as I stated previously, everything flowed very well and you held my interest."
"The motion does match the description I suppose, although I don't get the sense that the square is walking or running. It honestly just looks like it is tweeking out. The object does change colors though when its speed changes. Aesthetically, I think the program is quite pleasing."
"The description isn't very accurate because it seems that the walker mostly runs at the same speed. I mostly see green squares of where the walker was, but every once and awhile i'll see a red one. The colors don't seem to clearly show a difference in speed for me. The walker seems to mostly be walking the whole time instead of running."
"The description matches the patch exactly. Great job, I like the idea of it being a bird."
"Yes, the motion does the description of the behavior of Question 2. The ""bird"" does fall blue, and then flies and goes green. However, the motion is not contained in the window, so instead of falling to the ground, it's a loop of the ""bird"" falling."
"Yes, the motion matches the description. I see the blue as the bird falls and then the green rotating rectangle as it tries to fly, then the motion is repeated on a loop."
"Yes, the motion matches. But I am not sure what ""moves East"" means; it appears to move in a random direction when it tries to fly. But the way that the majority of the distance traveled while falling is straight down with only small variation is realistic for a free fall."
The motion matches the description very well as it definitely seems like a bird is continually falling and trying to fly. the different states do a fine job to mimic this.
"The motion matched the description very well. After reading the description, I felt that the different rectangles became different people. Their movement were unique and vivid that gave the ""street""(the window) life. Also he used different color changed when a new column of rectangle showed up. Very impressive."
"Yes, because the squares are moving in the upward direction but stopping every now and then to ""sidestep"" and then continue in the upward direction."
"The movement more or less matches the description, although it seems this person is stuck walking in a VERY crowded area. Maybe Time Square."
"Good job. The walker matches the description pretty well. I think it's interesting that the rectangle can only move in four directions rather than diagonally as well. It wasn't noticeable at first, but it's different from the class example. I also like the color changes."
"It matches. The rectangle moves very slowly for 3 seconds and then starts moving fast. When it exceeds the top, it appears again at the bottom and changes a color."
"I think the description of your sketch is pretty accurate. It reminds me of fireworks rather than rockets, with all that changing colors. However, the only thing that threw me off was the mousePressed action. When I click on the screen, the trail disappears, and it doesn't seem like a rocket/fireworks anymore. Other than that, good job on the sketch!"
"The motion satisfies the purpose of the assignment, though there are no constraints to limit its movement inside the screen."
"It basically does. Though, there's not food. :/
 
 
 
 
 
 Also, I noticed that there was nothing to keep them from going outside of the window."
"Yes, the description matches the animation perfectly."
"Yes the sketch does match the description above for this project. I think this is a great project that had a lot of effort put into it, and the objects really do look like butterflies with various rectangle shapes fluttering around and ""showing up"" one right after the other. They do stay within a small access, while still fluttering randomly."
The description matches the general behavior of the sketch although I think there could have been more details. In addition to their description the butterflies were changing color and leaving a trail.
Haha! This is awesome and very creative. Their movements are very much like butterflies. motion matches the description.
"Yes. The motion matches the description. I liked the description, it was funny. The rectangle does exactly as it says, staggering to the exit."
The motion that I see matched the behavior in Question 2 because the movement of the character goes to the bottom left and then stays idle.
"It matches. Once the program starts to run, the walker starts to walk towards the bottom-left corner, kinda staggered. But it's not clear if the robot, after reaching the bottom-left corner, stops at that particular position or just moves out side of the window."
"Yes it does, however I think it's Elvis ghost moving southwest because it looks very faint/ghostly the way it moves, but I loved the way that they described the movement. It moves southwest because of (-2, 1) in their code making it take the quickest exit instead of using other ""routes"" or coordinates. It also has that jumpy/zig-zag movement because it randomly jumps between (+/- 4 pixels left; +/- 2 pixels down)."
The animation matches the description and I think the changing colors as the direction changes is also a very nice touch. It matches the behavior in that the walker goes straight then changes direction as it hits a wall.
"The description of the sketch accurately describes the motion of the object. I feel it's ironic though that the Rumba leaves behind a trail of ""paint"" instead of cleaning."
"Yes it does, it walks forward and then bounces off of the walls. I like that you used random with the colors, it makes an interesting design as it builds upon itself."
"Yes, the motion does match the description of the behavior. I like how it changes color to indicate a different line is being walked by ""the blind person"" every time they bump into a wall. Or even the Rumba description is spot on with your code."
"I do recognize the rumba motion. It's a little bit too slow for demonstration purposes, but it's pretty accurate. Good job."
The both the creative description and coding description match exactly with what is occurring in this code. It is a fun description and the amount of detail you used in both explanations is very well done.
The motion does match the description very well as it does seem to mimic two painters competing to color one canvas. They do walk extremely fast which makes the dashing of the bright guy a bit hard to see but you can tell that it is there and more prominent than the sad painter.
"Yes, the cool walker does move more vertically and the warm walker moves more horizontally. They both stay in the box and move about randomly and quickly."
"Yep. Sometimes the walkers move so fast they are a bit hard to follow, but their behavior matches the description."
The motion matches the description in Question 2 because the character overlap constantly with their consistent colors.
"Yes, the description matches the motion well. The red, raging parolee frantically paces in his home, quickly filling all the available space. Then it bolts from the home. It is a very nice looking animation, and becomes pretty funny when the story is told."
The animation clearly shows that someone is pacing back and forth which perfectly resembles someone who is on house arrest.
Yes because the rectangles are all centered in the window and continues to stay in that area for a considerable amount of time.
"The motion represented by the sketch matched the description of behavior in the assignment. The walker would turn more and more red each frame that progressed, until the 30 seconds were up. As soon as the time was up, the walker started to turn cyan like it was supposed to. It also started going around, but at a certain point, it went off screen and I didn't see it again."
The behavior seems to exhibit the described actions just fine.
I cant really see that its speeding up or slowing down. You said you wanted it to pop up on the other side of the window if it went out of bound and it did do that.
"Yes. The motion matches the description. It starts slow, speeds up, slows, speeds up... It worked exactly how it is described."
For the most part yes because the rectangles seem to speed off after some time but then tend to cluster for a bit as well.
"Yes, it sort of reminded me of fireworks, the way it explodes for 4 seconds and fireworks sort of leave a trail of smoke after it's done and then you have to load up the next firework so it stays in it's spot for 2 seconds and waits for it to be shot up."
The patch matches the description very well. Awesome job.
"It really does. Mainly talking about the end there, you don't need an explanation to see that it looks like bubbly water spouting out from the ground. Nicely done."
"The motion of the sketch is as described in question 2. The rectangle draws itself a couple of times around on the screen and skips to the middle of the screen then repeats again. However, what the description says about the duration of each behavior is a bit off by a couple of seconds. The rectangle moves around for about 1 to 2 seconds and then draws in the middle of the screen for less than 1 second."
The movement is a cool and funny one and it meets all the requirements.
It sure does match it. The description is pretty clever and fitting to what I saw. Good job!
"Yes. The walker acts normal within a specific area until prompted, and then returns to normal afterwards. I like the mouse movement incorporation."
"I think this patch excellently mimics the description given. Upon reading the description I was a bit skeptical as to whether or not it would look like the motion. But when loading the patch, it fits it very well and is also extremely entertaining to interact with."
"I sort of see it. It's very quick on how it reacted to seeing a celebrity, but it seems calm most of the time. It looks like the walker object continues going in random directions and it doesn't head back to its cosy little area."
This is one of my favorites; it's very different. You did a really good job depicting the fluttering wings and the basic movement of a fly. Good job.
"Yes, the motion matches the description well. It is obviously a fly. While sometimes the fly flies backwards, the twitchy erratic flight and the size changes really sell it."
"The motion perfectly matched what was written in the second question. The fly changes states every 2.5 seconds, and it has the four different actions. The only thing is that it wasn't a rectangle, but as the student wrote, the ellipse just looks better."
Yes it does. The fly seems to move in random patterns every few seconds and has several different behaviors.
"The description fits the behavior, for the most part; it does resemble lighting in slow motion. Though, it does not really look like it was changing color on my screen."
The sketch exhibits the described behavior very well.
Yes. The motion described is performed by the rectangle.
"The motion is similar to the way it is described in the description. The squares do move similarly to a lightning bolt, although I don't actually see the color changing like the author suggests. It's also a little weird to say it's repeatedly trying to hit the ground. That illustration of the animation seems a little forced."
"Yes it does match the description above. The lines of squares are moving from the top to the bottom right corner looking like a lightening bolt. I also like the transparent blue that they made. When I clicked the mouse and held it down the squares turned red, but when I released it went back to blue."
"The walker matches the description, but seems almost identical to the example given in class that had the walker tend to travel right. The only difference in the actual movement is that instead of wrapping the screen cleanly, there is a 400 pixel gap that the walker won't travel. Also, you do not describe how you coded any of it, so it appears that you just took the class example and made a few minor aesthetic changes."
"The motion fits the description in terms of it moving wild and sporadically, however, your description seems a little vague or open for interpretation. It might be a bit of a stretch to say the motion mimics us fighting for what we want."
It kind of looks like it. It is just really hard for me to get past that they are just squares(or rectangles). But it does what it was supposed to do.
The walker matches the behavior in that it stays still while moving slightly for a while before 'jumping' to a close by area. With the strokeWeight it gives the walker a cool fading effect that adds to the jumping idea.
Good job! The walker matches the description very well. It moves in a small area for a short while and then jumps to a new spot on the screen. It was obvious that the code was original and easy to understand.
Yes. The character seems to move in any direction and it also returns to the center when it goes out of the 500x500 boundry.
The description and behavior definitely match though there isn't really a story behind it. Maybe the spiral represents a bug flying in a spiral towards the screen but then dies cause it hit the screen. However I really love the coding you did for this. It looks beautiful.
"Yes, it does create the look of hand drawn spirals. I thought your use of expanding the radius was neat."
"Your description of what is occurring is not done in the way that was asked. You did describe it correctly, but just not as a character in a movie. However, the creating of spirals is really cool and entertaining to watch."
"Description and actual sketch look to be matching, but it's not described as if it was a character in a movie.
 
 This is also a really cool design. Great job!"
The crazy colorful motions do match the description you gave for your walkers behavior.
"Yes, it does, I like how you were able to use the millis(), I had a hard time understanding how to make that work."
"The motion described is actually described pretty well, and with your description it actually made the program come alive more than it normally would. You used the colors of the rect to help the viewer go deeper into your narrative, and it helps the viewers imagination create a world in their own heads using your sketch, This is a good mix of art and programming."
"I really like the creativity in the description. I think the description was made to fit the animation, but I feel it works here. The animation does display the erratic behavior of the scenario you presented. Visually, it is very fun, although the rapid switching between grays can be a little displeasing to watch."
"Yes, it does seem like the walker is running around before circling in the same spot then running around randomly again."
"The assignment matches the description, it works well in that the rapid movements are done with larger squares while the smaller circling movements are matched with smaller squares."
Felt like I just had opened a pop up window on the internet inviting me to play a game.
It's wonderful. The sounds are entertaining and grasp the meaning of positivity and negativity.
The approach is perfect. I learned that UI and presentation mode in Max is very critical to developing a successful patch.
"The header is very creative, presenting the challenge of attempting to locate the good key. It presents a nice, inviting title and lays out the challenge before you while still being minimal. The master sound button is a great idea, saving the viewer a little time by not having to scroll down and switch each individual sound button on. The logistic part of the patch, though, is much the same as we were presented in class, with a little extra fuddle and detracting clunkiness included."
"Once the master sound button has been toggled to active the process becomes as simple as pressing different keyboard buttons until the right one has been pressed.; in this case it is ""P"". The sounds are clear in relaying to the user the information of the keyboard button, good or bad, but seem like stock audio samples that lack originality and are devoid of personality infusion on part of the programmer. The design is nice, but the sounds aren't entertaining to hear repeatedly, so after two/three times, I stopped the program."
"This patch is very similar to that of the patch we went over in class. The good key and bad key branches are the same with two sfplay~ messages, two meters, two ezdac~ messages, minus the different sounds that correspond to each of them. There is also a comment box that says ASCII value for the intended ASCII number code."
The way how this patch was approached was the same way as the patch that we went over in class. Something that was different that I saw was the addition of the comment speech bubble. I did not know that that was a way that comments can be presented and is definitely something that I learned.
The patch is very simple and it's easy to understand the signal flow.
It is very simple and not particularly interesting in any way. I am somewhat bored by the simple sounds.
The patch looks very clean and well put together.
"The patch works perfectly, the D key plays back a ringing bell while all the other keys play back a snair drum."
"The patch is impressive and works well, I think that they even added in some extra steps along the way that made the patch even a little cooler."
"The patch feels simple and clean, seemingly trying to be easily understood rather than technically efficient."
"It feels great to use. The sounds are simple and quick, making it easy to identify what key I've hit. The sounds end quickly which gives enough of a response to know if I hit the right key or not."
"The patch uses two different sfplay~ objects, one for success and one for failure, which makes the patch look easier to understand even if not as technically efficient. I've learned that simplicity can come from making it technically less simple, although it's not surprising or exciting. I am not sure what could have been done better."
The patch looks simple and logical.
"The experience is simple and mechanical with little conceptual salience, but there's still a sense of elementary investment in the patch's function. I'm happy when I hear the ""success"" song instead of the ""failure"" song."
"There isn't any major technical innovation here, but everything works fine."
The look of the patch is very organized and easy to understand.
My experience with the patch is that it's very goofy. It was difficult to find the key because it wasn't a letter. So I just pressed every key till I could find it.
Very simple and easy to read vertically from top to bottom. Same as in class.
"The patch looked very nice and professional. It seemed to contain all the correct pieces and buttons so based on appearance, I would give it an A."
"I thought the sounds were very creative. Now I had my volume on super loud so my first press and the ""W"" key was a bit shocking but after the initial shock I was good. The sounds themselves were actual song pieces which I really enjoyed. It was entertaining, energetic, and I would have fun playing around with this patch."
"This particular patch looks very professional to me. It is as cleaned up as it can be. As I have said, I did enjoy the fact that they added songs in place of a voice for the yes and no key. Did I learn how it was done based on the patch itself, no. However, I am no eager to do so. Honestly, there is not much more to be done to this patch to perfect it. It's self explanatory and easy as can be."
The folder wasn't labeled so I had to open it to see who files I was looking at. The patch was very simple and clean. There are a couple of toggles that I didn't see the purpose for.
The patch was simple and easy to navigate. The sounds are entertaining.
"The patch appears to be very nice, and well put together."
The patch works fine and emits both a yes and a no sound.
When getting the right key it plays a sound very similar but more inviting then when hitting the wrong key.
The bad key has that weird ambient noise and good key is more like an electronic music tone.
The patch is good it takes two different types of sound to play which is a good mix.
this is a good patch it combines two different type of sound and its cool to listen to.
The buttons used are great and they get the job done right with the sounds. The no sound is a simple gong which is better than just saying no and the yes button is cheerful music like the type you receive when you beat a level in a video game.
This patch was very clean and put together nicely. All components were accurately described and neatly placed.
"When running the patch, I couldn't get the sounds to play unless I clicked the ""ezdac"" object. This may be a Max thing though, so I wouldn't discredit the creator for it. Prior to critiquing, I had been listening to music, so when the evil laugh played, I actually jumped a little in my seat because it was so loud. I got a laugh out of it, and smiled fondly when I found the right key and recognized the Beavis and Butthead(or what I assumed them to be) laughs. The sounds are goofy with a touch of terror that still has my heart pumping a bit from the surprise. One thing is for sure, I'll be turning my sound down a bit when moving on to the next critique."
It's very simple. Text states clearly how to make the patch function and what it will do.
"It's entertaining. The laughter provokes memories. The ""bad key"" is kind of creepy while the ""good key"" is humorous."
Pretty simple patch. Not complicated to look at.
The good key is pretty entertaining with the beavis and butthead laugh.
It was just like the example in class.
"Looks similar to the example in class, easy to follow, uses the open features along with the names of the files."
"Very entertaining to use, made me laugh just like the patch did, and it was easy to tell which key was the odd one out."
"The audio was the most surprising thing, most of the patch looked similar to the class example but it was the audio that made it unique."
It's pretty basic and straightforward. Lots of notes to let you know what's going on. Simple.
"When I first hit a ""wrong"" key, I thought I'd hit a ""right"" one, in that the sound of the evil laugh seemed so much more final than the Bevis and Butthead one. The whole thing felt a little goofy, but that's to be expected in a design that's all laughs."
The look and feel is simple.
"The ""no"" sound was startling, and the ""yes"" sound was comedic and nice to hear."
"The ""yes"" key wasn't a letter, but a number key, which I thought was interesting."
The patch looks similar to the patch made in class. It feels generic.
"It feels like the 'no' feedback sound is too long and drawn out, yet the 'yes' sound is great and entertaining. It leads to a really annoying experience until I get the right key."
"This student approached the assignment seemingly to complete it without adding anything new or special, so there is nothing surprising or exciting. I didn't learn anything, as it wasn't unique compared to what we have done in class. It's hard to say what could have been done better since we haven't learned much in class."
Looks and feels very similar to the patch built in class.
the good key sound is very entertaining.
the formula shown in class was used in this assignment.
"Before even using the patch, I could tell that program would run smoothly. It was well laid out and designed, nice and clean."
"After playing with the patch, I thought it was fun. I liked the user's sounds a lot. I could tell the user is a goofy person because when you found the good key, it played the ""oooh-yeah,"" from Ferris Bueller's Day Off."
"The patch technically speaking was basically the same layout as instructed in class. However, they did a good job overall. I especially liked the sound files."
The buzzer sound for hitting the wrong key was really loud and annoying to hear over and over again.
"Technically, the patch worked perfectly, but there was nothing exciting about it."
the victory sound was a bit too long. but i felt like i watching a movie intro or playing a game
"The patch is very clean, everything is laid out in straight lines and is extremely easy to understand. There are no unnecessary elements in the patch."
"The bad key sound is extremely annoying so it really makes you want to find the right button quickly. I also liked how the good key's sound went on for a rather long time. It gave me a sort of Super Mario feel, similar to when the game is beaten and the credits start to roll."
They didn't do anything exciting or surprising but they made the patch as simplistic as possible and I almost think that's better than any extra elements. It makes it so the patch is very easy to read and the user can understand everything that's taking place.
"It's a very simple patch, it's easy to understand the signal flow."
"The patch is a simple variation of the assignment, and looks very clean. It is structure neatly from top to bottom and I know how the patch flows."
"The bad key is bad indeed, it makes you want to hurry and find the good key. Now the good key is rewarding, I do believe it is from a video game and I cannot recall which but hearing it makes me feel as though i just beat an intense level of some sorts."
"The patch was simple and straight forward with an ease of design. They did add a ""victory"" and ""loser"" aside to a ""yes"" or ""no"" which added to the whole video game music choice. I did do a similar design and structure."
"Surprised to see something so simple, was expecting something a little more elaborate. In general it was aesthetically clean and pleasing."
"Very easy to use and the instructions in the information box made it clear as to what to expect. The sounds worked well, somewhat goofy but entertaining. Generally effective even though slightly over simplistic."
"Seems as if they recreated the very minimum technicality needed to fulfill the requirements of this projects, fortunately the sounds were entertaining. After looking at the sub patch I realize that there was a bit more thought put into than I realized. Appreciated being able to go in and look at the inner workings of the project. May have been fun to have some other sounds included. Always learning, realize I am going to have to up the ante next time!"
This patch looks different from the other ones I've looked at so far. It was definitely interesting. I would assume this person has prior knowledge of Max as this patch appears to be a bit more advanced. It was set up as a project with multiple folders instead of a single patch.
"I had trouble figuring out what I was supposed to do. The directions were a little too cryptic for me, and while I might just be too new at Max, I feel like the average beginner might have been as confused as I was. The sounds were kind of hard to understand as well. I could barely tell what either of them were saying - if it hadn't been for the note, I don't think I would have made out the ""amen"" correct key sound."
"I think that the patch that you made is pretty clean, and unique. I didn't see the selective key in that which is an excellence idea to hide it."
"I think that the sound quality is a little bit poor, so I can hear a lot of noise. The style of the music isn't in my area of interest, but I think it's pretty cool."
"I think that the coolest thing of your work is that you used the sub patch, so you are able to hide the ""Good key"" form the user."
simple yet obviously complex
0
they did something nobody else did. a step up from the orig. assignment.
"This look is completely different from the rest of the patchers i have seen today and it is very unique and makes me wonder what it will do, it comes with instructions on how to use it and it has a short simple design."
It seems like an advanced form of patch because i did not quite understand how to get it to work. It says that the sound file is amen and in order to play it you have to from a new word from the word amen. It is a bit confusing.
I eventually got it to work after reading the instructions carefully but overall the patch itself looks short at a glance and there is a sub patch that actually does all of the work in it and i think that is pretty fancy.
Pretty simple patch. Not complicated.
"I cant get the sound to load at all. I dont know if the problem is on my end, but the last patch worked for me."
Couldnt get it to work.
"The patch looks well organized in terms of visually clean, the connectivity of the patch is very sharp and visually appealing. The terms associated with the yes, patch are sounds that would be an obvious strong indication of the, positive, ""yes"" or negative ""no""keys. Prior to interacting with the program I couldn't actually see the speaker connected to the rest of the model or the meter."
"The functionality is simple to use, which is great. There was a voice recording of the word hallelujah and a voice recording of word your wrong. Even when I had my volume on high they were still hard to hear, and the word, ""your wrong"" was very hard to make out. I think the simplicity of the words chosen is good because it is obvious as it relates to this project. I feel the user experience would be straight forward in terms of the literal, ""good key/bad key"" assignment."
"The patch is clear and easy to use. I like that there is a button that I can press to activate the wav files instead of hunting for thegood Key, or an ascii code map. I like the meter and the level meter attached to the sfplay object, it helps to know that the sound is playing."
"It is cute and funny. I like that the bad key sound is ""aint nobody got time for this"" and that when you find the ""good key"" it rewards you with a strongyea!. The sounds were very fast and clipped very tight. It made it feel abrupt."
The first thing I noticed was there were no comment boxes. The coding was not complicated but instead met the minimum requirement and was straight forward.
"I like the patch, it is clean and simple. I like the color sound meter."
I love the sound. The audio is an actual person talking not just tones.
I figured out how to open finally!!! Catchy recordings
lThis is the basic minimum nothing was done beyond the tutorial
"It is small and compressed, which I like, but the opening window was very large. It it clean and well placed, easy on the eyes. However, there are no comments, which would make it difficult to follow."
0
"I think that the patch that you made is clean, and well organized."
"I love the music that you picked. The quality of the sound is pretty good, and the style is really unique, and not clichÃ©. I'm really enjoy playing this interactive."
"I think you did a good jobs, and also picked a really impressive music, however I think that you might be able to try something more advance or more creative."
"Looks like the class example, clean and easy to read. only thing that differs a bit is the volume control."
"Feel very simple to use, the only thing was the volume control has a setting so at first even when I turned the speaker on I couldn't hear it. After a little time I was able to figure it out."
"The sounds varied a bit compared to the class example, it was a little more pleasing then hearing just ""yes"" and ""no"" over and over again."
It felt rather complicated and guideless.
"It felt confusing due to the lack of directions on the sound bar. With that, it lead to the patch being rather complex."
"The presentation is very plain, and looks like they didn't customize it. It is kind of symmetrical, but it looks like they finished it and didn't experiment."
The sounds didn't work for me at first and I had to mess with the live.gain~ function before it made any noise. The actual audio clips were nice and soothing.
"They used the live.gain~ operation, which I was unfamiliar with, so it's cool that they tried something different. But it didn't play sound at first which is basically all it needs to do. They are also the first person who didn't have the YES key blatantly showing, so that's great."
It is minimalistic and neat. It feels easy to follow if you know introductory knowledge of Max/MSP.
"I'd say it feels like the ""average"" good key bad key game where you quickly sort through the key choices until you find the right one, guessing roughly where it might be based on the key print feedback. It feels a bit more beautiful than goofy based on the audio feedback. It still leads me to feel mildly amused and more engaged with playing with the audio as it's a bit more appealing."
i couldn't get it to work with keyboard buttons just the on screen buttons but i liked it still and the sounds were simple yet effective
"It looks like there is no actual selection operator for the good key or bad key. There are comments however but they didn't seem to relate to the content of the patch. My question is: were they trying to use the MATCH object, but didn't use it successfully?"
"Did not work. There was no operator to select a good or bad key. The wav files were pleasant to listen to, a soft ""hello"" and ""goodbye"" with a very nice voice. It made me want to use the patch but I could only press the open operator to make the patch play a sound."
"Not adequate, extra simple patch and concept but it still did not work."
The patch looks well organized though I am not entirely sure the purpose of the boxes that say what is.. and awkward. It is easy to understand the flow of the code.
"I was not able to make any sounds happen, and I did not see a select function used so the program seems to be struggling to complete the required code. It is easy to see where I am typing, however."
Code not complicated.
I could not get the sound to work with the keyboard. Only by pushing the open buttons on the patch. I am not sure if this is a problem on my end though.
Couldn't get it to work properly.
"It looks very basic, much like mine."
I could not get the keys to trigger sounds.
"They did the basic requirement, but I was unable to trigger the actual sounds."
"Feels like the class example, simple to read, and this one has text boxes with directions which make it a bit easier to read."
"Sounds were entertaining, I enjoyed the ""whoosh"" a bit more than the ""yes and no"" shown in the example."
The patch looks nice but with a few extraneous pieces. Unfortunately there is a note telling me exactly which key is the right one so I didn't have to look for it. It kind of defeats the purpose of this patch.
"The sounds were unimpressive. They are just two random noises. They don't feel ""right"" or ""wrong"". If I didn't know what the patch was supposed to do, I wouldn't even know if I had hit the correct key because the sounds are just random, no good or bad feeling to them."
"Technically, the patch was perfect. Though there was nothing original about it except the sounds, it did what the assignment asked."
The feel of this particular patch is very clean cut and to the point. The symmetrical alignment of the objects helps create a simple yet effective vibe.
"Using the patch, I didn't ever feel like it wasn't working well, however, I was not really engaged. I didn't truly enjoy searching for the ""good key"" because the sound font didn't draw in my interest. This lead to a one-dimensional experience as in, I was just observing the functionality of the patch."
"It looks and feels a bit complicated, as if there is too much going on the screen at once."
Both 'yes' and 'no' give a response that I would expect. The 'yes' is positive and the 'no' is negative.
"The student added in an extra tool for showing the audio level, yet besides that, there is nothing surprising or exciting. It seems that they tried to add more to it, even with the little we have learned in class. It's hard to say what could have been done better."
"The patch is laid out well, and looks nice. There are lots of comment boxes and everything is a nice distance away from is each other."
The sounds are movie quotes and take longer amount of time to run than the other sound bits. The meter and levelmeter both light up and provide a visual feedback as well as the sound.
"I really like how things are laid out in this patch, it is pleasant to look at. They did show the winning key however, which doesn't make the game much 'fun'. There are some added functions like the meters which give the patch more personality."
"I think that the patch that you made is really clean, and well organized. I also saw that you have a decibel meter to measure the sound, which is really cool to me."
"I think that the sound that you picked is really funny, so I'm really enjoy using it."
"This patch is neatly arranged. I noticed that in addition to the regular meter, they also had a level meter, which was new."
"I think the sounds used where really unique. I was thoroughly amused by both the Spongbob and Austin Powers soundbites. I seem to enjoy the projects that can make me laugh more than the others, and this one definitely did the trick. The patch was straightforward and easy to use. I found myself searching for the right key even though it was outlined in a comment, just to keep hearing the sounds."
It looks like the patch that was assigned to us!
"The yes sound nice, but the no sound is the sound that most macs make when pressing a wrong key so I was confused for a second. That was clever actually. 
 
 The buttons lit up in different colors, that was a good idea."
"Nothing here really surprised me, I liked the colors on the buttons. And the sound choice made me think I was not even clicked on Max so yeah that was a good idea."
"It looks pretty basic, with some added features like the meter and color feedback from the bangs of incorrect and correct key choices."
"It's amusing that they used the traditional mac error sound and the other sound for the correct key press was generally pleasing. It feels pretty easy to use, mildly aesthetically and audibly pleasing and neatly organized. It gives a pretty good experience, but this game gets old pretty quickly after you've played it a handful of times."
"They did more than the minimum for this assignment so kudos for going through the little extra effort to beautify your patch. I learned I could easily have added color to my patch for a slightly more pleasing experience. Also, people will definitely hate my ""wrong"" sound and that's sadistically pleasing."
"Overall, the design was fairly simple with very few alterations to what the instructor created in class."
"The sounds were entertaining to listen to; ""Funk.wav"" was pretty funny to listen to."
Nothing very exciting or surprising was noticed in this project since all elements of the assignment were similar to the instructor's design.
The look and feel was simple.
"At first I thought my computer wasn't working because of the generic sound that Mac's usually make when a key doesn't work, but it was actually the ""no"" key."
"The patch was simple, one ""yes"" key."
At the moment I cannot hear the sound files of any of the programs because I am not on a Mac I think. Patch appears to be working correctly based on the buttons lighting up.
The approach was pretty straightforward ad followed the in class instructions.
"At a glance the patch looks good, there is plenty of room and space for it to be seen without confusion and it comes with some handy tips and comments on how to get it to work if you do not find the key it has the answer so it does not frustrate you. The overall look is simple yet amazing."
The patch overall worked perfectly and it was amusing and it follows the assignment just right when it comes to requirements and layout. I actually did learn how and where they acquired the sound bar from because i could not find that for my project which i know would have been helpful for those who maybe could not hear it.
The overall feel of the patch is very technical and clean. The patch looks similar to the one done in class and has nice layout.
The sounds are goofy and funny. They make you want to do the patch over and over again because the sounds are entertaining to listen to. It leads a very pleasing and funny experience for the user.
They approached the coding assignment very typically. The patch looks similar to the tutorial done in class. They added the meter for extra flare. I did learn that I should have used more comments in my own patch since it can be very confusing without them.
Looks very basic.
It was kinda funny. The militaristic samples rose a chuckle out of me.
They did the basic requirement.
conceptually it was compartmentalized.
there are several ways to code. this student opted to keep things seperate instead of coding together.
goofy. the sounds used are goofy.
"abrupt. Others took time to make the code elegant, long, or truncated, but you could see the connections. Inputs & outputs. None are seen here."
"The patch was clean and simple, once again I noticed the extra toggles. There was no media lines used so it felt kind of plain."
The patch didn't feature a comment telling me which key was the right key. I was forced to push buttons in an attempt to find the right one and the no sound became annoying. I didn't really enjoy the search because of the no sound.
"Small boxes in general, somewhat squishy and close but it does not take away from the performance of the patch. Same like the one in class."
"I only got one of the sounds to trigger - the ""no."" The Ace Ventura sounds were cool and all, but only if it actually works."
"The patch looks very good, and is condensed a lot. But still looks like it took some technical abilities to make."
"The patch works great, and responds to the keys accurately."
"The sounds are awesome and unique, this is a very well done patch."
"This patch is very simple, and it's easy to understand the signal flow."
"Firstly, the sounds are fantastic. The creator expertly utilizes the concept of ""cuteness"". Even though the patch is very simple, the fact that it makes ""human"" sounds gives it an air of humanity."
"Visually this patch is extremely sharp looking. The cable line that he used to connect the components look like a piece of art work in itself, with a very mechanical feel. The patch looks very straightforward and user friendly, and followed the guidelines of the assignment exactly."
"I thought the user experience was overall very strong with this patch, not only from visual aesthetics, but from the functionality as well. The sounds were entertaining, especially the good key. The sounds were definitely goofy, which make the user interface more fun."
"This patch was techinically very visually creative and functionally as well. I did learn to try to stretch myself creatively in terms of trying to program my patch to have an artistic quality as well, and not just merely connect components for functionality purposes, included stretching creativity in sounds waves as well. I do not really have any recommendations for improvements, I think they did a great job."
"Looks similar to class example but minus the ""numbers"" box to see exactly what number this was, this made it a bit tougher."
"The sound was sort of boring at first...but then I found the ""yes"" button and it made me laugh for quite a while, good use of the file."
"Coding was very similar to class example, easy to follow, and it had quite an entertaining outcome."
The patch itself gives off a very good feel. It was not as clear as some of the others and at first it looks like they may have missed a step but they just simplified it to the very core.
I really liked this patch. It was super creative and the sounds were perfect. The good key sound is one that continues on its own for quite some time so its as if it is actually speaking to you and I personally thought it was very funny. This particular patch makes me want to try harder and make more creative and funny sounds.
"The patch followed the guidelines perfectly. This patch did not contain each step by step explanation for each button which I have been used to seeing. However, it works perfectly, it is still easy to navigate and I don't think anything could have been done differently."
The patch looks very simple. Easy to understand what is intended.
"I was not able to get the patch to run. However, the description that was provided makes the patch seem like a very neat idea. I liked that the idea was musical and hope to see something like this that works."
"The patch was approached as expected. However, the way that they used musical elements was particularly interesting."
Doesn't look like its going to work.
Couldn't get the code to work. I'm not sure if this is a problem on my end.
Couldn't get it to work.
"Looks good, everything all lined up. I like it."
I could not get your keys to open and play. When I unlocked it to check if they were linked to a file by double clicking on it nothing happened.
"Right off the bat, I noticed that there would be more than two sounds that could possibly be played, and probably some at the same time. No descriptions to how the sounds can be made by each part, but from looking at it one can guess what's going on with it."
"I honestly could not get it to play anything. I can open each .wav file in the folder to find out what I'm supposed to hear, but I can't replicate that in the patch. There also wasn't a level meter, so I had no idea if sounds were actually playing or not, or if there was a problem on my end with my speakers. I really wanted to know if I could play 'Sweet Home Alabama'."
Clean looking patch
I felt like I was in Vegas for a minute.
"nothing out of the ordinary, just the basic patch from the video."
"Visually logical and simple, including colored buttons indicating ""correct"" and ""incorrect"" input."
This is perhaps the most basic incarnation of this particular assignment. The sounds are predictable and obvious in their connotation.
"Nothing about the patch is surprising from a technical perspective, but it works well."
"Nicely laid out, and the two buttons, one for 'yes' and the other for 'no', are color coordinated for the user's convenience. Everything is labelled, and even which key is the 'good one' is spelled out as to leave out the guess work."
"It was a quick experience, but pleasant. The sounds were not obnoxious and nicely leveled. The sounds were traditional positive and negative sounds for guesses, so it wasn't an out of the ordinary experience."
"Technically, it was a simple setup, and nothing too out of the box. Everything worked as it should, and when it should. Nothing exciting, and nothing boring or unusual. As for what could be done better, I got nothing since everything worked and everything was laid out as it should."
"I enjoy the use of different color buttons for notifying when the Good/Bad key is struck. Very simple, easy to navigate."
It feels very simple to use. It's stated exactly what you have to spell out in order to hear both sounds and activate the good/bad key. I enjoy the sounds.
They approached it as we did in class except they added buttons with different colors for visually informing when a good/bad key is struck. I learned that the colors of the buttons can be changed to give a visual representation of when keys are struck.
"I like the concise look and minimal use of space. The author still gives the message, but without a lot of looking around. It feels like the author copied the template, made it more concise, and added their own versions of yes and no."
It is easy to use though I had to do some guessing to find the good key. I enjoyed the futuristic sounding files and it reminded me of space mountain. It would be well used with some kind of space ship cockpit.
I think they completed the assignment as asked without adding a lot. The buttons are a nice addition to see which side your typing is going through. It adds a good visual cue in addition to the audio output.
"So far this patch is the smallest I've seen. Everything is very condensed which almost makes it look clustered but also gives the patch a sense of unity. It's very clear everything works together and makes the patch seem like a whole thing rather than a bunch of parts working together. This aesthetic is very interesting, I haven't seen it before."
"This one was actually a lot of fun! I loved how the good key's sound started off the same as the bad key's. I can definitely see someone just pressing the keys one after another and completely missing the sound, which is amusing to imagine. The sounds overall reminded me of the inside of a sci-fi movie spaceship."
I think the way they organized the patch was surprising; a lot of people had their patch spread out far apart and made sure the user could separate the different parts easily. This patch sort of bunches everything together giving it a new feel. I don't think there's anything they need to do to improve their assignment.
"The patch itself is pretty good, the sounds are funny and entertaining. Its a decent patcher but I actually did have to hunt down the specific good key which took a little time but then again that is the point of this assignment so all in all its a delightful patcher. The space sounds blew me away."
"Very simple, I like it."
I wouldn't use sounds that have such similarities unless you are trying to confuse your audience.
It looks nice and simple. Very small and compact.
"The experience was OK. The sounds were fairly interesting although it was a little confusing. For some reason I though the wrong key was the right key, but that just may be how I took the sound effect."
at first glance the patch looked complicated. however the patch notes were helpful.
This patch was very entertaining. it almost had a soundboard feel and I just wanted to make custom mixes of train sounds.
the patch uses the same formula shown in class but adds more sound and key options.
It looks fairly organized and well constructed. It feels very straightforward and efficient.
"I think it works very well. The sounds are cool and offer a kind of variety, so that was nice. The experience was always unique due to the variations in the sounds which made it that much more entertaining."
"I think the patch looks really cool. I learned a few new things like the counter. As I went through it, I thought of ways to make it simpler, but Overall, I think it looks really good. Great Job!"
"The patch was pretty entertaining to work with and would be something fun to use for a kid. Although, when I was working with It I was confused with what keys I was pressing to make the different sounds. The sounds weren't necessarily ""good"" or ""bad"" therefore I think the keys I was pressing should have been more straight forward but they felt random."
"I think you did a very good job technically working on this. Although the code was confusing to me, after I played around with the sounds for a while it was easier to see how it works. You also did a good job explaining the changes that you made, making it easier to understand. After looking at your code and the changes made on it from what we did in class, I learned a few new ways to connect the keys and make it so there is multiple ""good keys"" and ""bad Keys""."
"Kind of confusing. It seems as though Tom tried to create two different Good Key Bad Key patches and put them together to form one. It seems that he experimented and tried to create a more advanced, more complex version of what we made in class."
"I'm still a little unclear about how this patch works. Instead of just one ""Good Key"" there are two different ""Good Keys"" which play two different sound files of trains. The ""Bad Keys"" play the sound of 2 more different trains that alternate back and forth every time you hit a bad key. I find this to be rather confusing because all four of the train sounds are very similar to each other and it's hard to comprehend which keys are ""good"" and which keys are ""bad."" In total there are 5 different sound files present in this patch, which I kind of don't understand. I wasn't able to hear the fifth sound, which apparently was a bell that was also supposed to match with a specific key."
Looks very simple and similar to the patch shown in class. does not have any notes.
the experience is very simple but it works.
again. very simple.
Simple to look at. Nothing different or unusual about the patch. Basically what we learned in class. There were no comments on the patch to let me know what the good key was.
"I liked the music patch of the good key, it went well with the symbol sound of the bad key. There was definitely a reward there for the effort to find the good key."
"The patch looks somewhat like a copy of the patcher example, but with some stuff removed and moved around. It is clean, but does not seem to have a particular orginization attached to it."
"It is the most difficult experience I ran in to because I could not find key 110 and the author did not tell me which one it was. Granted, if the purpose of the code was to find the key, then the author completed this marvelously. I was also still able to listen to the sounds, and this helped further the appeal."
"They also seemed to follow the pattern laid out in class, without adding anything additional. This completed the assignment but did not go overboard in any way."
The look of the patch is virtually the exact same as our example from class last week.
"The patch feels identical to the example, as for usage. The sounds for the ""bad"" keys sound like a hi-hat or other cymbal on a drum kit, and the ""good"" key plays a full groove for almost 10 seconds. Overall, it's simple, and does what we wanted it to."
"The aesthetic look of the patch is appealing and it has all the components with some of the other patches have been missing. The design of the patch is predominantly on a vertical plane, but here is uniformity and it looks balanced with how the components were placed. It looks user friendly and well defined."
"The visual appearance is definitely uniform and appealing conceptually by the simplicity of the design. It definitely allow for a user interface that is not intimidating. I really like the sounds in this patch, they are entertaining. The bad key, had the wah, wah, wah zany sound effect, which is definitely a fitting sound for this key. They good key was great, it reminded me of being in an amusement park riding on a roller coaster."
"I think the coding was approached very well within the constraints of the assignments, meaning there was no other new or different technical components. However, it looks like they really did master the patch that they did complete. The only improvement I could make is to be more aware of the artist element of design within the patch. For example, the cables connecting the components could be connecting in a way to create more of artist representation of the piece."
"I think that the patch that you made is really clean, and well organized. I also saw that you have a decibel meter to measure the sound, which is really cool to me."
"I think that the sound that you picked for the wrong key is really funny,and the one that you picked for the right key is really amazing, I was so surprised when I heard it, so I'm really enjoy using it."
"I think you did a good jobs, and also picked a really awesome music. The most impressive thing in your project is a decibel meter to measure the sound."
Looks very basic.
"I liked the samples used. Trying to remember where the sample for the ""good key"" is from. Sounds familiar."
