I think if you expanded on what you wanted your music playing device would do or even look/ sound like it would have stretched your thinking a bit more.
"If I was your partner Id suggest adding visuals to make it more of an installation. I am not much of a sound girl so I would like to come up with some visuals to add to your abstract music piece. Do the different sounds have to by programmed to keys or can we think of a more interesting way to ""play"". Or are the sounds you play the important part of your project? Is it strictly abstract or can there be a way for the user to express themselves having more control???"
"All three of the questions were answered, but, in my opinion, were a little vague. The answers stated pretty much what they wanted to do, but I didn't read very much thought being put into these answers. All questions are answered clearly, just not in a very detailed manner."
"Using the ideas laid out with creating music using RGB values, I think we could make something that also looks at everyday objects and people to create music in an experimental manner."
"A program that uses the keyboard controller they proposed in the first idea, but instead of just playing & recording music, the keys would also play colors that the creator would match up to certain notes or sounds according to their perception of emotion."
"In all of the projects, he or she discusses the use of lasers. Though the projects are very similar in their use of lasers, they are also fairly different ideas. The student made a good effort to expand upon their ideas and give details. They want one project using lasers as a form of data transfer, laser interactive project and another basic max/patch laser project."
Using a laser to initiate sounds while playing a game. Passing data via laser doesnt seem plausible to me.
"There are definitely three separate ideas proposed, but all based around similar technology: lasers. All seem like pretty solid ideas; one being to make a simple environment where laser are pointed at targets to create musical tones, another using laser signals to beam data between devices, and the last using lasers for a target practice type game."
"I feel the student elaborated enough to get o good idea of what they are aiming for.
 
 The first idea is to create some kind of musical instrument incorporating lasers.
 
 The second idea is to use lasers to send information to different devices they also stated that some of the technology may need to be further developed.
 
 The last idea is some sort of shooting game with lasers and a projector."
I think that the video game idea using lasers is possible to accomplish this semester. But maybe using a wii remote would work better than using the kinect since there may not be too much motion.
The first one the student wants to make is a music system which controlled by some unique instruments. The second one is to build anthropopathic robot soldiers. The third one is to build a virtual reality glove.
"The glove project is the most interesting project. It is hard to track person's hand moving, I know. But you can develop the idea further. For example, if you can use the glove to remote manipulate some objects. Or even an idea, but I think the introduction video will be awesome."
"Overall, I believe this person put a decent amount of thought into the ideas. Each idea is written vividly and thoroughly. 
 
 The first idea is basically to create a device that generates midi sounds with an arduino and some buttons/knobs. 
 
 The second idea is basically creating remote control soldiers for the use of the army, essentially making military deaths a thing of the past.
 
 The third idea is to create a glove that works with the oculus rift to track hand movements to be translated into the virtual world within the oculus rift."
"If I were to collaborate with this student, I would try and find a good blend between using the oculus rift and glove ideas, with the robot army idea. They both are necessary for eachother, so I think that makes complete sense."
"These projects - a simple midi controller, soldier drones, and a video game glove - have all been proposed many times. We see these types of things all the time in movies, and occasionally in real life. It doesn't seem like the thinking was stretched very much, but that previous ideas were re-used."
"Honestly, anything I can think of has already been done. My initial thought was to combine 1 & 3, to make a glove that works like a midi controller. However, that was basically done recently by Imogen Heap. Another idea would be to combine the soldier drone suit and the game controller. Just having a full-body controller for VR systems, but that would take more than a semester."
"This student made a sincere effort in proposing the ideas, as each one feels thought out to the extent that they can be in such a short amount of time. The first idea was to make a midi controller, which seems to require hardware that is simple to make and some programming that this student is not confident in doing. The second idea was to make unmanned robots that function similarly to human beings, allowing soldiers to control one as if it was their own body without the risk of death. The third idea was a glove for virtual reality that can mimic the actions of the player, allowing the player to interact with the virtual world similarly to the real world, potentially with haptic feedback."
"The virtual reality glove would require a lot of fine-tuning in order to make it complete, and although I don't have much experience with working on hardware, I would be able to work on the software end of the project. Rather than trying to replicate the exact feelings of the player moving their hand, I would shift towards a more game-oriented end goal by programming the glove to sense the user's reason for using their hand then acting accordingly (for example, a grasping hand motion would be registered as the user trying to grab something, which would then cause the user's avatar in the virtual world to grab something). This is more game-focused than the original idea, though it would be the same project overall."
"The answers displayed here show that a lot of thought was put into these questions. Everything was answered clearly and concisely, with lots of detail and creativity."
"I'd love to work with the arduino live music control. One thing we could add would be programable visuals with the live music, in order to enhance the live experience. This could be with projection mapping, color recognition, or even animations."
I like the idea of having an app that allows you to interact with a concert you are attending. I also like the idea of having sort of one central app that allows you to research and donate to causes around the world. I think that would be the best bet.
"The ideas feel somewhat proposed as they are, though I'm left with many questions as to how something would be made or how complicated it would be. The first idea talks about skills more than what can be accomplished. It seems that this student is not entirely aware of what they can do with their skillset, specifically due to lack of programming knowledge. The second idea is understandable yet I'm not sure as to how this would take a large amount of money and time. It feels like setting up an incredibly large and intricate information system, then giving that information to the user in a simplified format. The third idea is clear though the student does not write about how something like that is feasible; I feel that it's less of a technical project on the student's end and would mostly require interacting with and convincing the performers and producers at the concert to let them hook up things for the app to work."
"I'd shift this student's third idea away from live concerts and more towards an app that could simulate what an actual concert might be like given some music, wherever they may be. It would consist of the same features and would focus more on the app's software than interacting with music that is currently playing, allowing users to play a song and change various settings to make it sound as if it was being played live. I would feel that it would be more feasible and more about the technical efforts than interacting with musicians themselves."
"Seeing as how this student is very arts based with design, video, and music, I feel we could work well together as I do myself have many artistic qualities (I am also a musician) but I also have some programming experience to work on the more technical level. I think it would be possible to work on some iteration, if not the complete idea, of the third proposed project. We could probably achieve a basic prototype form through the use of Max MSP I would assume. We could blend their experience of live sound and my capacity to finagle Max."
"Overall I felt that the student made a good effort to explain their ideas. 
 
 
 
 1. An unspecified rough app or computer program. 
 
 
 
 2. A series of sensors in bikes and/ or cars that alert drivers/ cyclists to potential collisions. 
 
 
 
 3. An app that the city/ police can use to see where cyclist have had accidents or poor experiences so that changes can be made to prevent future accidents."
"Rolling with this idea, the student and I could make an app that would allow people to rate and share experiences of certain routes or part of a city for use by cyclists. Users would record their experiences, along with a positive or negative rating, and link them to a certain area on a map of the city. Overall ratings for different areas would show up over time, giving both locals and visitors a map of safe biking routes and notable places to avoid."
"This student is looking to create a prototype of an interface that is beneficial to those who like to ride their bicycles on the road and care about their safety. I think they did clearly propose their motivations and thoughts, being concerned with improving public cycling collisions and allowing some sort of warning system."
"I am a cyclist myself and have designed my own apps on photoshop, so this actually is interesting to me. Maybe in the app include some of the traffic going on in areas and color coding the safety with the roads."
I believe that some solid effort was put into this by the student. The ideas were well thought out and put lots of variables into consideration with cycling. Cycling is a largely used mode of transportation so these ideas will most likely be successful.
"I like the idea of simplifying things like routes and safety in cycling. I think we could think up ways on how we could branch out with these ideas or even conjure up some more,"
If I was your partner I think Id like to focus on researching the ways large cities are doing this. Id like to propose a way to physically make cycling safer threw lights that interact with cars and the roadways. If we could come up with a way to make communication easier for a cyclist while they ride I think that would achieve some part of your goal. If we could update a rider of upcoming dangers as they ride that would be helpful.
"This student definitely went in depth and was really detailed about what they would do in these situations. I honestly believe they could get a lot done in a week from the first question, do something really awesome and a lot of good from the second question, and continue their project on and make it better in the third answer."
"I could definitely collaborate in making a video or board game with them, creating sketches or doing animation, and I think that would be a lot of fun, especially if it is combined with the other two ideas, into an interactive game, maybe for physical therapy or something. I wouldn't be able to do much with the VR part, but I could definitely help with design."
"The first, week-long project would simply be an outline for a longer-term project.
 
 The second idea is to develop some form of cerebral interface for virtual reality games.
 
 The third idea is to create an AI that learns from it's mistakes."
I could help to develop the visual representations for this world the AI will explore or meld with. But that's about all I'd have to offer to this project.
"1) A quick board/video game
 
 2) NCVR - Virtual Reality that is truly immersive (utilizing all senses)
 
 3) Creating an AI
 
 
 
 It seems like they really put some thought into it, as it all seems to build upon each other. However, the semester idea seems perhaps too ambitious."
"It might be interesting to do sort of an augmented reality space - a physical landscape used in a ""game"" in which a user completes tasks/challenges with the aid of things like visual displays (a la Google Glass) and actuator gloves."
"He/she has ideas about the game design are related human body and nervous system. His/her plans and ideas are related each other. Also, he/she has rough design concept and I think he/she has potential energy to develop and realize the system. That is not perfect yet, but it would be great project under his/her plans during this collaboration project. Also, his/her NCVR project is not far away from today."
"I can imagine his/her project would be foundation stone for future project about the NCVR and AI. If he/she meet and collaborate with designers such as a visual, sound, and media installation person, this project would be great interactive gaming system. This project is quite impressive for me."
"I can tell that this student is very passionate about virtual reality, as am I. This NCVR sounds like an excellent idea (albeit a little risky) but it would definitely be the next step in VR. Visuals have been covered by systems such as the Oculus Rift, but that's as far as it goes (to my knowledge)."
"By the look of it, I think we could make a really good VR game together. The ideas and goals are all there, we would just need to work for a long time to reach those goals. Game are a huge part of my life so I could think of lots of ideas on how this project could take off."
Yes they made a effort with their three ideas being. 1. To build a moto-Bike of some sort similar to a moped. 2. To create a water powered system to create energy. 3. To make an interactive environment with lasers and such.
I thing a projection based art project would be cool we could make some sort of projection mapping setup that allowed the laser graffiti to be made on a number of different objects.
I think they thought about what they wanted to do. It was what seemed to be as much elaboration as needed for this type of assignment. It seemed like everything was more or less just an idea and there was nothing that had really been thought of.
This student mentioned wanting to do some kind of game and I wanted to do games and incorporate fitness and gaming. So with an arcade game we could find a way to make something that got the body moving. He also wanted to do something with generating power but with water. Well we could make a game that generated power based on body movement. That would be really fun.
1. Put a motor on the bike. 2. Find some thing can save water or other resources. 3. Using laser technology into projection mapping.
"I am very interesting in the third idea. I am also like projecting mapping and interactive project. Base on your idea, I would like to do some ""gun"" game. The gun could have the laser in it, so when you ""shoot"" the wall, the wall will has a ""real"" black hole. On the projection mapping wall, we can create some visual effects that has strong connection with the gun."
"I love the idea of cars running on water. The change to the environment it would make would be spectacular. Also, the laser gun and light graffiti both sound really fun and artistic."
"We could probably make (with a bit of programming knowledge) an awesome game where, as it has been said, draw lines with lasers on a giant projected light wall. The fundamentals seem pretty basic for something that could turn out to be really cool."
"They actually seem to emit a sense of having a clear idea on their heads that may just be much easier to describe with pictures rather than words. i can see their vision, but not much of the whole concept yet."
"Okay:
 
 
 
 I picture this proposition of creating some sort of ""photon graffiti"" that would SOMEHOW work by vandalizing anything you want in an extremely removable way. Maybe something that could last for a few hours only or who knows.
 
 
 
 Maybe I am thinking way too outside the box, let's try again:
 
 
 
 A projector that is kept on for scribbling anything on your wall for reminders and what not, using ""light pens"", and not worry about having a corkboard or whiteboard for everything you wanna plan. Go caveman on it and scribble freely in the room without making an actual mess.
 
 
 
 These sci-fi movies sometimes have these fancy holograms to make a visual explanation of their plans and we could develop something similar, except much more versatile and less impossible like holograms that pop out of thin air."
"Although they made attempts and I think their ideas were in the right direction because the person wanted to tackle larger problems; however, they didn't propose workable ideas."
"I would take idea number 2 because at least we both would be interested in some kind of reform in education funding. We could work on an artpiece that would show how our government allocates money. Since we would be tackling politics, having the funds of billions of dollars would allow us to say whatever is necessary, regardless of what corporations/people are offended."
"I mean, they didn't really propose anything for the first idea. Technically, they answered the actual question to the fullest, because it asked ""what could you yourself accomplish in a week?"" They said that with one week to do something, they could get the planning phase done, and start to draw up concepts to actually get a finished product. There was no idea stated. For the second, they gave more of an idea of creating a way to make higher education accessible to all those who wish to further their learning, but beyond that there was nothing. The same goes for the third idea, there was not a specific idea to state, but rather that it would be better to work in a group to get stuff done."
"Literally, it's almost impossible to get something done with this students ideas, because there is nothing to go off of. The only thing to go off of would be that we would be coming together for one cause."
"I do not believe that this student took much time and getting this homework assignment or really tried. There isn't much to be able to think about here, and although buying convertibles for everyone sounds like a good idea, it doesn't have anything to do with our major or creating something from nothing."
There is nothing I can collaborate with another student on because they didn't write enough idea down for something to be created in a partnership.
"Idea 1: It is not really a full idea, but rather a general 'first steps to a larger project' outline.
 
 Idea 2: The idea is to assemble a team that can work to find a way to make a college education free for everyone, or to buy everyone a sports car should this team prove unsuccessful.
 
 Idea3: This is not really a full idea either, but it builds on the idea of assembling a team presented in Idea 2.
 
 
 
 While the specifics of the process this student would like use when starting to work on something are fleshed-out a bit, the specifics of what this student would like to do are only expressed in the Second idea concerning free college education. So it is a little vague."
"My ideas involved animation, and this students ideas involved collaboration/team-building and taking on a major issue (College costs).
 
 
 
 So a joint project might take the form of an exploration of some major problem or concern, and an animation that enhances some aspect of our efforts or our reporting. It might be used to explain the problem, to explain a proposed solution, to explore the issue further, or report on the successes or failures of our efforts. In many things, including animation, a team usually make it easier."
I feel personally that I could help with the first idea of planning things and putting them into motion. One thing I could do would be possibly build some rough prototypical components of some ideas they have to gauge how it might function in a real life application.
"I believe that the student made a sincere effort into their answers for ideas 1 and 2, and to a lesser extent idea 3. Idea 2 could have used some more clarification as I am not wholly sure what these group games are, while idea three could use some expanding upon.
 
 
 
 Their one week idea was to create a mini-game that tested the end users reaction time and post their ""score"" on an internet serve, thus allowing players to rank their times.If they were given no time or money limit they would want to construct a world fitness center that both explores the concept of group games that promote healthy fitness as well as having machines/other equipment that help the users stay fit. They are willing to offer prize incentives for working overtime. For their semester goal they wish they wish to be more involved in their gaming company and create several more games for a college student audience that help them with their class studies."
"For your semester project goal, I think you might be onto something. Many freshmen come into college shocked at how different it is in comparison to high school, and thus, take a while to get settled down into their new world. Maybe you could construct a game that helps freshmen college student ""learn the ropes"" if it were to how to survive your college experience. Maybe tailor made to ASU instead of a general college survival guide, you could make games that illustrate how to use Blackboard or Ctitviz, maybe include a 3D map of the school in a racing game that subconsciously teaches you how to get around the school campus."
"In the past I have worked on classical compositions, musicals, and even post production for short films. In this case, I would love to use my skills in sound design, musical composition, and as a musician to integrate sound and audio into the experience of games. I would love to find a way to use sound in a way that it has never been used for in games to create a dynamic interactive experience in games. On a much more simple note, I would also like to create the theme music for this person's games."
I would like to work on this project because my idea is about fitness as well. If we can incorporate on kind of campaign about well-fitness and create an event or program that utilize this game I believe this project will be incredible project to work on. If people see there are incentives on exercising and also being fit because the ultimate goal is about fitness and seeing that it is fun to work out they would participate on the event/game.
"Idea 1: a simple game that measures reaction time to different situations, and shows these times against the times of others.
 
 Idea 2: A collection of games that promote exercise and fitness, some of which incorporate gym equipment, all of which are part of a larger businesslike organization.
 
 Idea 3: Expanding an already established gaming company that focuses on college course material.
 
 
 
 This student has clearly-proposed three ideas and has touched on the details and motivations for them."
"My ideas involve animation, and this student's ideas involve gaming (specifically concerning fitness and foundation building for classes).
 
 
 
 So a joint project would probably take the form of a video game. I have done 3D art for video games, and any game that incorporated character animation (as so many do) would align with my main interest in animation."
"The ideas here are fairly well-thought-out. None of these ideas are very detailed, but at this point, they have enough information that can see the thought put into the ideas."
"I like the idea for the graphic design that would get the world excited about helping make earth a better place to be. I have a similar idea that I think could go along this, adding social media capabilities, and getting as many people involved as possible."
"I think I would want to scale down the second idea. Instead of changing the outside of a building, we could make a projection that alters image based on interaction of viewers in front of a sensor such as a kinect."
"There is a coherent project idea in each answer. 
 
 
 
 1. A set of hand painted images than could be formatted into booklets for special occasions. 
 
 
 
 2. An interactive building facade on a skyscraper that changed base don the people in it or by it that highlighted them in some way. 
 
 
 
 3. A business that creates games that are both educational and entertaining."
"Working on a small game or proof of concept that taught geologic principles through exploration of underground tunnels and caves would be a potential idea. The idea for this is to have students discover different types of rock and geological processes while actually down in the depths of the earth, showing why this information si interesting firsthand."
The three ideas can be combined into one. I am thinking of displaying the wedding book's pictures at the side of the Skyscraper where people passing by can interact with the pictures with their hand movements as though they are playing video games.
"Well working within the education game, you could possible extend the controller of the program into physical space. Using arduino to create physical controllers would be simple and could create a new realm for the game to be played in."
"As I said before, it would be awesome to have a game that allowed the game community and its aspiring developers be the creation factor of the maps, levels, and content. I would love to collaborate and work as the creative/business side of the video game design process. It would be great to work as a team to deliver content to existing games or even new games that promote community driven creation within games. This would give power to the game community, almost like an ultimate sandbox."
"You know what you want to do so the stretching your thinking can be done in the context of your video game. since we are talking about making the world a better place does the game teach the user, inform them, anything other then just entertaining them?"
1. A first person shooter game. 2. He would like to do many games to gain experiences. Then he will use his experience to do a big game which has important topics to the society. 3.A small exploration driving game.
"As the author mentions, he is a game level designer. So I am interesting in his game level design. It would be fun to explore the key of each level in order to reach the next level. But I have no idea about how to do that. Hope to see your game!"
I would choose to help work on their mobile device application. Although I would try to specialize the app in one particular area like sound and the measurement of decibels. From there I could branch out into using gps tracking data in order to link connections between the decibel readings and the location of the device. This could be used to help find good study locations and develop better studying habits.
I think that the student displayed a nicely planned out set of steps that would allow the project to flourished.
"If I was to work with this student, then I would extend the app to maybe act more like a artificial intelligence machine to interact with its users."
"If the student is serious about creating an app, then maybe we could create a storytelling app with a significant visual element, like a web comic but with some interactivity. Maybe a choose your own adventure with dynamic visuals and some animation."
"I like the idea of using patrol devices, but this can be risky since I'm sure they will not be cheap and you have to worry about people messing with or breaking or stealing them. I also like the idea of creating an app as sort of a personal side kick."
I think these ideas are pretty well thought out and practical. The doorknob thing sounds kinda fun. Each of these ideas take the concepts and skills we're developing in DC and applying them in imaginative ways.
I'd love to draw storyboards for this person's Great Wall idea. The idea of displaying cultural history in a visually dynamic way is intriguing to me.
"Using their supposed knowledge of Arduino, I would assist them in using the data they proposed in getting through temperature in their first idea in order to create a program that reacts to the temperature of bodies within the area. The more people there are creating more heat in the proposed area (that people would stand in), would affect an animation's speed. The colder it gets and as it is left alone, the animation would slow down as if being frozen in time."
I think that the student made some really good suggestions about creating a arduino program that has some sort of interactive aspect.
"I felt that although these explanations were brief, and could have used a bit more detail, the ideas were expressed relatively clearly in such few words. 
 
 
 
 Idea 1: A program that uses an arduino and three buttons. When a button is pushed, an assigned color appears. 
 
 
 
 Idea 2: A program that makes people feel as though they are part of a virtual reality world. The program would involve the whole body, and the user would feel as though they left the real world and were transported into the game. 
 
 
 
 Idea 3: A program that allows a person to drive a car or fly a plane using only hand movements."
"I really liked the idea of a video game that submerged the user into a virtual world. I think perhaps with a pair of virtual reality glasses, some sort of smart gloves and shoes, and perhaps some sort of outfit that had different sensors sewn into the material, this might be possible. This project would however, likely be very involved, and take a great deal of time and resources to accomplish."
I like your idea of building a simple arduino program with a simple sensor system to interact with the user.
"If I was to work with this student, then I would recommend that we create a system that tracks hand movements but instead of a RC car or plane, we would use a simple robot."
"I think it would be possible to use their hand movement idea and incorporate it into some kind of game, perhaps made in Unity. A possible idea would be to use the Kinect and have the camera track hand movements, and certain hand movements would control the character/plane/car in a simple game."
I think they tried to streak thinking somewhat. Their 3 ideas are - 1. An interactive system with arduino. 2. Make the matrix. 3. A digital physical system that tracks movement to control an RC device.
I think creating a system to track movement and turn that into to controls of an RC device or like a game or somthing would be fun. This has alread been done using the kinect or WII so a new cool way to do it would need to be devised.
"I had a bit of difficulty understanding the third idea, but overall I felt that Tammy explained her ideas well. 
 
 
 
 1.In a week, Tammy would brainstorm, collect data, create a virtual and a paper prototype, and gather information from users and experts regarding her project. 
 
 2.Tammy would create a therapy program for children with special needs. She would use her resources to hire experts in related fields, and try to create the best program possible. 
 
 3.Tammy would create a mechanism that would record neurological feedback, and heart rate, when a user is exposed to certain stimuli."
"The project of most interest to me would be working to create a therapy program for children with special needs. I know little about this field, but I believe the project would require a great deal of research, and the creation of applicable audio and visuals."
"Given the intent of the assignment the student satisfied all the needs and was very thorough throughout the entire assignment. They had very clear purpose in the entire assignment and were very concise.
 
 In the first idea the student stated the steps that they would go through in order to complete a project in a week. In the second idea the student was very clear on what they would do with the money in the answer and what they would use the money for, and to create a machine for special needs children. The last idea was the student wanting to create a project that records brainwaves."
"Since it's one idea this is easy! For a semester, to have us actually work on, we would definitely need some scaling back. As far as a sort of machine to measure brain waves, I have no idea how to use it, or where to get one. This poses a big problem for us. As far as something for the heart, this might be a little difficult too. I'm not sure if you want an actual heart sensor, and what you need it for. They do have pulse sensors (http://goo.gl/7kFhfY) that you can use to measure heart rate, and are used by putting the sensor at either your fingertip or your earlobe. The people that created the sensor have a newer version of their product, which may be a better source of a pulse. 
 
 
 
 With all this, I'm not sure what you would want to accomplish. I'm not an expert on psychological aspects, so I'm not sure what would come out of having these strapped to a person, especially just for the heart sensor. You can tell when someone maybe is scared or something, but as far as getting that data and making something out of it, I have no idea. Especially because you want something that helps special needs children get better treatment I guess?"
I like the Dubai Vacation for brainstorming. I feel that you need to have diversity and variety of locations to brainstorm ideas. If theres ever a trip like that count me in! As far as the mobile mouse case idea goes I think you should finish the product. I saw the pitch and the progress in the previous semester and it is an interesting product.
The only idea that you had was finishing up the mobile mouse case and it seems like your are really focused on getting this prototype finish I would like to collaborate on this product to get this finish if we had to work together.
1. The student said that he/she can finish lots of things in a week. But it depended on the resources. 2. Go to Dubai for brainstorming.3. Mobile mouse case! Sounds cool and I hope you can tell more details about it.
I would team up with this person and try to figure out a way to record and add video clips into a short loop composition that could be layered similar to how audio can be recorded and looped. I could just have certain opacities when I record 3-4 different clips and it would create something different and new every time to project.
"If we were to work in a group, I would try to blend the ideas of a digital physical system, the app, and the internet infrastructure to somehow create some sort of interconnected environment that is connected to all and is controlled by the phone app. This could be used to interact with others within the environment to do whatever the user wants. For example, if someone walks into the environment, I could trigger a device to turn on from my app on the phone."
"Maybe you could mix your first and third idea for a mobile application that interacts with your physical installation. People could download the app and answer a few questions (like what did you eat for breakfast?) and when they arrived at the installation you could scan for their device, pull their questionnaire, and projection map objects that correspond to them (like waffles if that's what they had for breakfast). The beauty of it would be that other participants in the installation would not know that you were to the one would had waffles, so it would provide a level of voyeurism to each of the participants allowing them to look into someones life without not who they were looking at."
"The student here is perhaps overly succinct, but seems confident that they can create something worthwhile over the course of the semester. I really like the idea of trying to increase and improve internet connectivity in this country. Other industrialized countries have bandwidth and speed that put us to shame. Replacing all of the old copper lines with fiber would be awesome!"
"If the student goes with creating a game I'd love to do character and concept sketches, storyboards and other visual aspects."
"Idea 1 is to make a graphic that they would paint on their motorcycle, from design to finish. Idea 2 is a movement to get people more active in the US. Idea 3 is app that connects motorcycle enthusiast to each other."
The app is a great idea because as far I know there are none out there for motorcyclist enthusiasts. For the project you could even combine the idea of graphics for motorcycles and use the app to share cool projects that people may be working on or want to collaborate on.
"I feel that all of their ideas could have been expanded upon, and I am not really sure what they had in mind for their second idea. What will this campaign to promote activeness entail? Would their be commercials and public events to help promote activeness? How will people commute to work? Will you design an Arcology and thus eliminate cars altogether? I could feel the sincerity behind their words, but they could have been a little more concrete with this desires, this would have helped in the clarity of their plans.
 
 
 
 Their ideas: 
 
 
 
 One Week: They would either design a decal or paint a mural on their motorcycle.
 
 
 
 Unlimited Time and Money: They wish to create a project that somehow makes people more physically active, they wish for this project to lower to usage of automobiles (and thus leading to less pollution and car related deaths).
 
 
 
 Realistic Semester: A social media app that acts like an internet forum for motorcycle rides and those who just generally love motorcycles."
I really do believe that this student made a sincere effort with this assignment and thinking about what they really want to do in these situations. I think that they really dug deep in thinking what they would want to do based off of what they love to do with their hobbies.
"I think that we could really collaborating on something here. For one, I love print design and working in Illustrator to create fun graphics, so I think we would be able to collaborate on motorcycle designs to possibly sell! 
 
 
 
 I also believe we could make an awesome animation for a health PSA, since I would want to do an animation for my answers last week, and they want do get the word out for people to be healthier, we could collaborate and make a really fun animated PSA about it, and with the money given to us, that we would be able to use it for advertising and getting celebrity endorsements."
I believe the student put in a lot of effort but I only seem to see two distinct ideas.
My DC concentration is insound so I would be very interested in finding a way to incorporate his sound project.
"I like your enthusiasm, and I would definitely work on a project with you if you brought this kind of attitude into a group project. I too would choose to work on a project that could extend beyond the classroom into helping the outside world with what I have learned within the DC program. Last year I worked on developing a garden that took care of itself with the help of an arduino. However this proved to be a really difficult project for only one person to work on, and was never completed to it's full potential. Therefore if you happen to stumble across an idea that your really feel passionate about, I would be on board to help make it happen."
I would like to start with the idea of the short film and trying to make the world a happier place. I feel that an inspirational short film can help the world or a group of people feel happier. What would we base it off of and what target audience would we push it towards?
"I believe that with the first idea is definitely something that both me and the student could work on. I love films and I love working on films, I think that could definitely be a fun project to work on with someone else, I also believe we could combine elements of the second idea in order to make an inspirational film about how people can be happy and train themselves to think in more positive ways."
"I really would love to go off of the whole making people happy thing, but again, emotions are very subjective. Unless we actually had something that is proven to effectively make different people happy each time they use this product, it wouldn't work well. I mean, we could take a survey of everyone in DC and ask them what they think is funny, or what makes them happy, and you can make a short film on it?"
"The student clearly proposes three separate ideas. For the first, the student's idea is for a short film. While they don't say what the topic will be, they do say that the short would not include explosions or CGI of any sort.
 
 
 
 For the second idea, the student would spend the money on something that could give clean water, or make self driving cars.
 
 
 
 The third idea was to create music."
"I think he/she seem like a visual artist and want to make project is related with visual things. However, it was hard to realize and imagine that is actual project that he/she want to make."
"Idea 1: a short film discussing a topic of interest.
 
 Idea 2: Work to organize and fund the creation of something that could provide clean water to people, or use a similar process for a different issue.
 
 Idea 3: Make music. 
 
 
 
 Though the specifics are a little vague, this student has proposed three ideas and has touched on the details and motivations for them."
"My ideas involve 3D animation, and this student's ideas involve filmmaking, humanitarian organization, and music making.
 
 
 
 So a joint project might could take many forms. Humanitarian concerns can be (and are commonly) addressed in both film and music, and animation can go with both. Maybe it is an animated short film (or at least partially animated), or maybe it is an animated music video to a song or series of songs."
"Idea 1: an interaction based installation that incorporates data from different devices, or robotic display.
 
 Idea 2: work to develop cheaper hardware to benefit future designers and problem-solvers.
 
 Idea 3: A screen made up of a grid of independent, hanging LEDs that move to emulate the reflection on the water in a glass in response to a participant disturbing it."
"My ideas involve animation, and this student's ideas involve a robotic screen that reacts to participants' interactions.
 
 
 
 So a joint project might take the form of an installation that incorporates animations expressed in physical 3D on a robotic screen and viewer interaction."
"First idea is to develop an interactive light show or system.
 
 The second idea is to find ways to make things that are expensive and time consuming to do now, cheaper and more efficient.
 
 The third idea is to okay with light, water, and perception."
Together we could create some kind of interaction between a physical and digital system.
"Yes, I think they though deeply about what they could and would do."
There is great expanse on ideas and passions in this idea run. The first idea is to use MAX/MSP to create a sound to light interactive system. The second idea is to create a theatre company that can reproduce the quality of theater performances here in america in countries without significant funding for musicals and theatre performances. The third idea is to create new content for a musical play.
I have created musical compositions for musicals in the past and I would love to be a part of a team to create new content for musicals. It would also be a privilege to find a way to create a good quality theatre performances in other countries.
"Perhaps a more augmented graphic novel, with thick ""pages"" for sensors and actuators, so we could provide sound effects (using tiny speakers) and some motion (motors under paper). Like the pop-up book of the future."
I can see where this student was heading. So there ideas were thoughtful but just not expressed deeply through the assignment but it is obvious they have passion for this project.
Well they appear to be interested in graphics and rich story line. We could certainly make a roleplaying game out of their novel.
"I think he/she seem like a visual artist, especially 3d animator or interactive media. I can imagine this interactive media system relate with human body. I think 3D animation project is so many potential energy in diverse field like he/she is interested in human psychology."
"I can imagine how his/her project would be great if these three ideas will be developed. To make a go of it, I think he/she has to collaborate with kind of artists such as media installation, sound, or performers. These project ideas are impressive for me and it would be very helpful to make human life better if you develop his/her own system in this semester."
"The first idea would be to develop a 3d character.
 
 The second idea is to develop a full length animation that is intense and far beyond a few month's capabilities.
 
 The third one is to build upon your skills as an animator and develop something you're proud of."
"We could develop some sort of animation together, as I had done a lot of animation work myself."
The student gave an honest and sincere effort and I believe gave some great answers. The student clearly proposes three ideas in their post. The first idea that the student proposes is essentially making a virtual character (which I think is really cool). The second idea was also a digital animation idea on making a very detailed video game. The last idea was about creating a digitally constructed visual.
If me and this student were assigned to collaborate for the semester I think we could make some very cool digital visuals because this student seems to be very experienced in making digital visuals and I am very artistic and creative and I think I could help this student with some great ideas for visuals that he could actually make on the computer.
Didnt go into much depth besides speaking of animation.
3D animation and psychology. Maybe a project that uses animation to help some sort of psychological disorder?
There are three ideas proposed with significant information for me to understand the ideas. The first idea is to create a website or game. The second idea is to create a virtual world with content that mirrors this world. I love the idea of replicating an reliving historical time periods. The third idea is to create a game with intelligent AI that can replicate a human player.
"The larger proposed idea is the creation of an entire virtual world and simulator that would allow for the user to transport themselves anywhere. The second idea is making a video game that centers around AI making it seem as if the computer's AI could be a human. The second idea is basically a smaller version of the first, larger idea."
"I think that this student and I could work very well together. My background is in computers and computer programming as well, I think we could take the smaller idea as is and make it into a full blown project."
"The first idea is to do some programming for a video game.
 
 The second idea is to create a very high end video game.
 
 The third idea is to create a less high end video game than in idea 2."
We could make a videogame.
If me and this student were assigned to collaborate together for the semester I would like to explore the possibilities of the students' last idea that involved a new way of playing video games with the cube that involves the first idea and some elements of the second idea.
"This person has a major interest in projection mapping and interactive environments, this could be relatively easy to work with the appropriate direction and resource management. Even if there is an inclusion of a clothing brand, the proposals are concise and clear."
"The student's first idea is to carve a unique wolf sculpture, idea two is vague but has an endgame of creating an emotionally evocative space for individuals, and lastly idea 3 is to create an installation."
"I do not think that I could help out with project 1 in much of a way as I do not have any carving experience, but possibly I could assist in the formation of ideas 2 or 3. The ideation seems pretty confident with project three so I think I could only assist in the actual physical construction of the installation, it doesn't seem like there would be much software involved. In idea 3 I could possibly help in the ideation process and define a solid idea of what the implemented project actually will be."
I honestly don't know what I'd have to offer this student as far as her project goes. She seems to have her concepts and procedures and work steps pretty thoroughly planned out and there's not much of a visually element that would make my drawing skills necessary.
They made a sincere effort and proposed three ideas. The first idea was to carve a hyper realistic figure of a wolf. The second was to create some sort of environment that creates something eco-friendly. The third was to create a frame to a viewer could see the light in some creative way.
"This student can definitely go different ways into what type of project he or she wants to do. However, I think that maybe he or she should stick to some sort of project that has to do with geometry or coding or both."
"If I was to work with this student, then I would suggest focusing on a geometry oriented project."
"The person has definitely thought about it, and although the second idea doesn't have an exact project, the idea is there. 
 
 The first idea is to make a sculpture. 
 
 The second idea is to somehow create a way to emotionally connect with other people using technology of some sort. 
 
 The third idea is to create an installation that in short, involves a light and it delivers a message about personal serenity."
"Time travel has always been an interest of mine. That being said, and Alternate Timeline Transportation Device sounds pretty cool. Paradoxes are no fun, so this seems like a much more safe alternative."
"I'm not sure exactly what we could work on, but it seems like we both have similar interests based on the responses (Twitch, gaming, time travel) so the ideas would definitely be alike."
"This person shows really fun ideas that may or may not be simple but are interesting to see. The ideas are quite clear with specific features. 
 
 
 
 Their three ideas are simultaneous video game plays, virtual reality device that allows changes in the user's past, and an interactive display with a projection mapping of a mermaid."
The first idea was linking multiple consoles together to be able to play multiple video games from one console. The second idea is to develop an alternate timeline device that would allow users to experience their lives if they made different decisions. The third idea is to develop a virtual mermaid tank in which the mermaid would react dynamically to the environment.
I think we could take the last one and turn it into a project this semester. The equipment is already easily available and it wouldn't be much of a stretch to bring this project to life with the correct sensors and programming.
"I think these are some interesting ideas but they are a little over my head.
 
 The first is for some Pokemon game but I'm not too familiar with Pokemon games but i like the idea of projecting older games onto surfaces to give them a new feel.
 
 The second idea is for a alternate timeline which sounds cool but I'm confused how it would be executed.
 
 The last is for an interactive mermaid projection which seems to react to sound and motion."
"The last idea seemed the most doable I would try and focus on scope of the project though.
 
 Would it be life size or smaller?
 
 How would it work in a crowded room?
 
 How many reactions would the mermaid have?"
"I think that the mermaid tank idea is really interesting, though it would likely be rather difficult. Making a prototype of this however could be feasible in a semester or two, where a smaller or simpler object or the skeleton of the mermaid model could be mapped into a special fish tank."
"As a game developer and programmer, I would be able to work with this student to create a game, given their lack of experience in programming. However, 'create a game' is incredibly broad, as games vary greatly based on their genre and theme, so it's difficult to lay out what type of game we would make; I would need to know more about this student's interests and what their goal is for the game."
"The student made a very good effort on his/her thoughts. All three ideas were detailed and gave the reader a good ideas as to what the student would want accomplished, and possible tools that would be used in order to accomplish their goals.
 
 
 
 Reiteration of ideas:
 
 Idea 1 - Creating a model of a stand to hold all of his electronic devices and chargers by his bed to watch from.
 
 
 
 Idea 2 - Creating wearable technology that is attached to the clothing that gathers solar, body heat, and kinetic energy, as a source of energy that could be stored into a battery.
 
 
 
 Idea 3 - Creating a virtual reality game for the oculus rift, likely a first person shooter, that also uses a suit, fans, and other devices to simulate a more realistic experience."
I think part of his third idea would likely be a good choice for a semester/year long project. A group of people would definitely be able to create a virtual world using Unity to create a simple first person shooter. This project could possibly be taken even further depending on the time and try to incorporate the coding needed to make this game usable with the Oculus Rift.
"The ideas here aren't too fleshed out, but you've already begun to think about what things you would want in order to make something. Consider finding the limits of the technology, and go down from there."
There are only two kind of vague ideas presented here. The first is a garden that would take care of itself utilizing an Arduino to do the physical work. The second is an interactive sculpture of some sort with no other details.
I think it would be feasible to build something like an interactive sculpture using sensors and computers to do the calculations and alter the sculpture.
"Your idea is very deeply thought out. Religion is an important aspect in an individual's life and it can help one out through college experience. I know the feeling of being wanting to fit into a group or service that you are interested and passion about. Your project seems very interesting, not everyone will agree to religion but they will agree to a community build upon passion"
I would be interested in seeing how far this project would go. I want to see the process of this project campaign and how it is develop. The ministry service is an project that look like it would grow by time not so sure about how big but I would like to contribute someway to see that project grows.
This person made a sincere effort to express their ideas. This persons ideas were about creating clubs and organizations to help teach respect and other important things to our ASU students. These are some awesome ideas but I would try and leave religion out of it.
I am not at all that religious but I would do my best to help set up these clubs and organizations. If they need an app or something I could help out and mix my idea into it but other than that I just don't see us collaborating.
"Not sure if the second idea is really for the billion dollars if not simply use $100 and get away with $999'999,900 at hand, but hey, honestly I would like some of that cheddar too. But I digress:
 
 
 
 This person has obvious interests in using projection mapping as a central thematic and makes absolute sense. Except, again, for the eyebrow-raising budget of a billion dollars for a simple project like that."
"These projects seem to be well thought out considering the constraints.
 
 The first is for a simple projection mapping on an object.
 
 The second is for a wearable system that communicates with projector some how to trigger different displays.
 
 The last is for a animation that gives the viewer two different perspectives, I think this would be interesting but might be complicated."
"The student I believe did give a sincere and to the point answer with their ideas, the student also clearly proposed three things. The first idea that the student spoke of was mapping animations on to objects and using the object's shape as a way of increasing the visual effects of the animations. The second idea was mapping and tracking clothing on individuals and using it for artistic purposes. The last idea was creating a projection that allows the user to step inside the object being projected on and view the shots from the characters point of view."
With these three ideas I believe that me and this student could work on some cool mapping project that uses the artistic aspects the student spoke of in the third idea to make a really cool visual experience for the viewers.
"Idea number one doesn't seem like much of an idea. It seems like this student is saying they would just spend the week brainstorming. Ideas 2 & 3 both have to do with getting clean water to those around the world who need it most. They also seem like the same idea, just in different words."
"I honestly don't feel like I know enough about the type of thing being proposed, so I have no idea how I would contribute. Although I do think 2 & 3 are worthy of the time and effort."
1. The student said he/she will prepare enough before doing a project. 2. Finding a way to clean water. Like to clean the rain water. 3. To build prototypes about collect water from the atmosphere.
The ideas are great. The steps of making a one-week project are organized. But they are too general so I can't develop more ideas base on that.
"Your ideas reminded me of the LifeStraw (http://www.buylifestraw.com/). This technology allows people around the world to filter contaminated water and allow it to be instantly drinkable through a straw. I think in a semester or two, a group of students could take a LifeStraw, and build on it even more somehow. Maybe use the same technology to where, instead of drinking from a straw, make a fast and easy way to clean and store this water instead for later usage."
I would definitely partner up on this project since it is about a subject that is very important in life and for society to have clean running water is very important.
Yes this student made a sincere effort to explain their ideas. One of their projects was about scanning magic cards and projecting some type of holographic image. The other was to make a portfolio of all the work they have completed and also a short animation film.
"This student has some great ideas, especially the studio idea. I would use my skills in web-development and programming to help out in any way I could to get a studio going."
Idea 1 is to make a stop motion video using action figures. Idea 2 is create an interface that would allow magic cards to become 3D mapped on to the field. Idea 3 is create a portfolio of all the artwork and projects they have created.
"I really like the Magic idea, at the moment the streams of Magic Invitationals are rather boring but adding in the spectacle of the 3D rendering could really ramp up the entertainment."
"Three things were pretty clearly proposed. The stop-motion idea is intriguing, as is the holograph-magic card idea (even if it's a little derivative of the yugi-oh anime). And the portfolio development sounds like a really awesome idea."
This person made a sincere effort and proposed three ideas. The first was to create a stop motion film. The second was to create an interface that scans and 3D prints magic cards. The third was to generate a personal portfolio.
"This entry suggests a website that builds on the great commercial success of JK Rowling's series of books and movies. 
 
 The interaction by the reader with the capability of creating their pathway is enticing for people."
"There is a lot of excess verbiage; it sounds like an ad for Pottermore. Your description needs to show more objectiveness, like someone just talking about it not someone excitedly looking forward to it."
"This entry is direct and to the point meeting the need of immediate satisfaction that this world now craves.
 
 It meets the challenge by explaining the site in a clear fashion without emotion yet allows the excitement of the fan world to glimpse through the basic unemotional descriptions."
"Interesting choice of future book. The strengths of your entry are in the wide variety of uses for blogs as well as examples for them. You have done a lot of research, and it shows. 
 
 The blog meets the challenge of future book by being a never ending, ever-evolving work of text contributed to by many."
"You have a lot of examples in your entry. If you remove those and just show a variety of blogs types, styles and topics and maybe a blog 101 that would work better."
Wow! Those are quite the concepts for reading in the future. You have listed a variety and their uses today and in the time to come.
There is a lot of information there. Reddit appears to be an ever expanding source of information. If this is so then it meets the challenge like the blog.
"Describing the lenticular printing process earlier in the summary might be helpful to the reader, allowing us to get a better mental image of what is being described without resorting Google to get a quick and dirty definition."
Fantastic description of the capabilities and (likely endless) possibilities of tumblr. Thorough representation of how you feel tumblr is changing the face of books/lit related media and the features available to bloggers.
Completed assignment on time.
"The entry specifically points to the book's uniqueness, in that it is not necessarily just an e-book or a website; it is her brand. This meets the assignment's challenge by being both specific and creative by finding a book that is very atypical."
"The future factor explanation is very well done. I definitely want to find something like this, as I'm sure most people who enjoy faster processing would. By appealing to the demand of the people, this entry meets the challenge, though it does not offer a way for people to actually find such a book."
"This entry did not find a specific book, but instead wrote about a hypothetical one. The main challenge is to think of books creatively, but this does not pinpoint something that I can actually go out and see for myself. I would suggest trying to find a hybrid-type book, or at least something that could become hybrid very easily."
"This is highly imaginative and definitely something that would be a fun, interactive experience for any reader. It meets the challenge by turning a book into a video game, something that is surely being worked on by the creators of e-books and web-books."
"By not giving a real example of such a book, this entry is not completed. While the exact book the author speaks of may not yet exist, an example should still be found, per the assignment. The author should find something that is similar so that I can at least see what they're talking about a little more clearly."
"Using a PostSecret book is a great choice. It is compiled of thousands of people's work, making it a unique, collaborative project (that, somehow, still keeps its secrets). The explanation of the future factor is spot on: it is a blog in a book, and surely a medium that will evolve into something great."
"Perhaps in the future factor section, the author could make a solid case for why exactly I should go out and buy it. While obviously I'm interested, what specifically makes this book extra appealing, and why?"
"The book promoted truly does break down barriers of storytelling, as the author states. It is a wonderful example of the future book, and giving many examples of its strengths makes the entry very convincing. Additionally, the author's telling is both engaging and compelling."
"Perhaps add more written examples in the middle section, creating an overall convincing entry."
"I agree with you that sites such as tumblr are growing to be exponentially popular. In addition to liking and reblogging photos, users can reblog and critique or praise an individual's work, which includes but is not limited to: art,photography, music, poetry, and short stories. Because there is potential for re-blogging content, if an individual posts exceptional work, their work is likely to become extremely popular on the site, which can be a very good thing for the original poster. I think that many people who use tumblr use the site for the exact purpose of discovering and connecting to other people's posts, opinions, and self-created work."
"The problem I see with tumblr is that there is no citation, and it is very easy to 'steal' one's work. In the tumblr guidelines, it explicitly states that all content you post is liable to be viewed and re-used by other people. This means someone can re-blog a story or poem you write, and totally trash it, or even edit it themselves. While this is wrong and most individuals wouldn't do this, there is nothing in the tumblr guidelines stating that this is wrong, and tumblr staff cannot be held responsible for if an OP is not given credit for a 'stolen' picture or post. In the future, do you think that there could be an add-on to tumblr that instates a rule or a policy that enables an original poster to always receive credit for their work? If books are moving to be completely online, would not this be necessary on a site like tumblr, if an author wanted to maintain their credibility and their autonomy as the original writer of a work?
 
 Also, another problem I see is that, while there is SO MUCH creativity possible on tumblr, there is not really a place for those who want to become involved in a story to go. If I wanted to read an entire, thousand page book, or even a book series, I would not go on tumblr to do it. It just isn't possible to read so much information on a post. In addition, an author cannot make any profit, or gain any credit other than recognition from writing a book - so if tumblr were to be the future of books, there would be no way for a writer to make a living. Do you think that, in the future, it would be again possible to add on to the site a place for writers of long novels / book series? In this add-on, could it be included that one would have to purchase the author's work before being able to view it and reblog it? This way they are still following the 'tumblr way' and re-blogging work, but they are also honoring an author's time and energy, and cannot simply view it / re-blog without giving at least some form of tribute. This would also make it a lot less possible for someone to 'edit' or 'remove' the OP's part in the post, and it would also still allow for a re-blogger to leave commentary - just, the work wouldn't be free, as books are not free. 
 
 Just a thought! I think the idea of tumblr being the future of books is genius!"
"I honestly do not believe you need to embellish upon your original draft before it is finalized; your work was clear, concise, and to the point, as well as implanting an interest and an intrigue in not only the work you described, but also in a genre of books that follows the style of your chosen work. I wouldn't change anything to this draft, so good job!"
"I do agree that websites such as Reddit are not only very popular now, but will also continue to be popular in the future. People want a way to interact with one another, and also want to find individuals who share certain interests. As you said, it is not just text that is used on Reddit, but also pictures. In addition, people can also bring in other information to help others out or to just share interesting experiences, and I think that people of todays generations and in future generations really enjoy that autonomy in writing and reading."
"The only issue I see with your future book idea is that, unless actual books / stories are uploaded by Reddit users, one cant really become involved / pulled in to a fictional world or fantasy land. For many, books are a means of escape, and many book readers want to become involved in the lives of the characters, want to understand them and relate to them, fight for them or fight against them; also, many individuals who read also like the idea of an alternate world existing. For instance, I believe that this is why so many series, like Harry Potter, The Hunger Games, or The Lord of the Rings, were so huge  because there was another universe that readers could disappear into. 
 
 Im not saying that there is no possibility for things like this to exist on Reddit  but your post didnt really give the feeling that users post stories full of characters or alternate worlds. I think that, if you were to include that in the future, entire books and stories will be uploaded onto Reddit, that this is the way books may be read in the future. For instance, if you said something akin to the following,instead of authors publishing books through a publishing company, maybe they will publish their novels through websites such as Reddit, as so many individuals use this website, it would give the sense that books in general are moving in the direction of being completely online through such websites."
"I believe that this description of the Role-Playing book was sufficient in answering the prompt questions. In addition, the OP made the Role Playing book seem exciting, challenging, and subjective to one's decisions and preferences, which many individuals will most certainly enjoy. The book is also not limited, it seems, to a physical, hand-held book, and can also be read and 'played' on e-devices, making it accessible from many different locations and in many different ways. The reader will be in control of the outcome of the ending, which can be a delightful experience for many individuals who prefer this type of book."
"The article is well-written and accurately describes the subject matter and how it can be seen in the future of the book, particularly in the realm of fan-author interactions."
"Describing a specific blog, rather than just describing the medium in general, would probably be a better way of showcasing the nature of the blog. However, if the author chooses to continue with simply talking about blogs in general, linking to specific blogs and blogging platforms would be a good way to showcase the diversity mentioned here, rather than just assuring the audience that it exists."
"""Annarasumanara"" is a Korean variation on the many Japanese web-based, comic-book style stories that grew out of the Manga and Anime and comics of a few decades ago and that have now become rendered as graphically enhanced software that can be displayed on computer screens. The strength of this entry is that it does demonstrate an important aspect of the continuing evolution of books by showing us an example of one segment of the ""reading pool"" that is now making the transition from print to digital format."
"This is a reasonable example of the direction in which future books are heading, but as the author continues to develop the field guide, it may be interesting for the reader if some of the history of the comic book, particularly as it developed in Japan (Manga, Anime) and Korea (Manhwa) is provided, as well as some thoughts on where all of this may be going as we proceed through this century and beyond. For example, it would seem that this style of reading entertainment -- especially popular to young adults -- is well suited for eventual transformation into 3-D renderings, perhaps even holographic, at some point in the future. In addition, some reference and relevance to our course readings (if possible) would make for a stronger case in point."
"This is quite an interesting interpretation of the intent of this assignment. Using DNA testing as a way to build a historical thread that can possibly reveal long-lost relatives from the past, or perhaps uncover historical facts about people that might help to strengthen filial bonds (or not!) certainly identifies an application of a current technology (genetic and genome analysis) that can be used in a very positive way. And the translation of the data collected into electronic formats will make it more likely that information converted from printed and pictorial media will be stored in a centralized place, with a reasonably high chance surviving for a very long time. You seem to be agreeing, then, that the eventual transformation of knowledge and information, including books, from the printed formats of today to more digitized forms is not only occurring, but will continue to happen until one day nearly all of our reading interactions will take place through a human-machine, electronic interface."
"One area in which this entry may fall short (as is the case with my own entry) is that a specific work is not identified. It may be helpful if an example of something like this could be found and then used as a supporting basis for the remainder of the field guide. The implication that the technology of the book and of information in general is moving toward digital is, I think, a valid one, but I for one would like to learn a little more about the specific portions of DNA components that allow us to be able to track historical genetic data and what this technology could afford us in 50 or 100 years. Also, it's always a good idea (as I'm sure you know) if our academic writing can be supported by relevant citations that support our statements and speculations. As your entry thus far is merely a rough first cut (for all of us), this is probably already in your plans as you work toward a final version!"
"This is a very good example of a current technology that is moving us closer to a time when written information is created, edited, refined, developed, critiqued, and stored in an Internet-based, 'cloud-like' environment. In a direction divergent from social-networking websites such as Facebook -- and as the author of this entry has explained -- Tumblr demonstrates one of the ways in which our book and information technology is changing from one based on printed materials to one based in a digital universe. Human interactions here are and will rely on man-machine interfaces that may eventually eliminate the need for printed copies of nearly everything. This example also welcomes wild speculation about the way humans will be exchanging information in the future!"
"Since a good example has been found that demonstrates a current trend in the timeline of 'book technology' (past, present, and future), In working toward a final draft, the author should not forget to provide a back drop to Tumblr, perhaps by describing more about what lead to Yahoo's acquisition of this technology, provide some more details about Tumbler itself (images, descriptions), and to speculate on where this technology could be leading us and how it will impact the continuing evolution of the book. References to course readings would also be a plus, if applicable."
"Kali's selection of ""Night Film"" for her entry for the field guide is presented very well and the embedded images provide visuals that help the reader understand the unusual characteristics of this book. Although scores of other authors have incorporated illustrations, graphs, images, codes, and other visual devices to enhance the reader's experience in 'living' the story, the merging of information that provides the reader with links and other interfaces to the Internet, the importance this additional information has to the story lines and the need to download an external decoder, while possibly annoying to some readers, is in itself an example of how the current technology of the book is using the wonders of the digital age in incorporating some of its interfaces as an integral part of the book."
"Kali's obvious skill at presenting ideas and information -- as her adeptness in articulating opinions in our discussion posts has already been demonstrated -- will be an advantage as she further develops the idea she has proposed in this first draft of her field guide. Hopefully, she will also include some thoughts on how the techniques used by Pessl in ""Night Film"" will evolve as the technologies for interacting with data and ideas (particularly 3-dimensional) progress to the point in which readers feel more like travelers through a parallel universe -- feeling the same sensations experienced by characters in the story -- than outsiders looking in."
"This is another good example of a book that uses current digital technology to enhance a reader's interactive experience (in this case, a children's book designed to be read on an iPad using iBooks as the e-reading application. Although printed books have provided an excellent medium to display vivid illustrations and bright colors for children, it is not until books began to be digitized and designed to be read on electronic reading devices that animations, voices, and movement -- all of which greatly enhance a child's interaction with a story -- that features such as the author has described are now possible. Selecting a children's book in demonstrating possible directions for the future of books provides ample room to speculate on what may be in the realm of possibility within the next decade and, indeed, within the next century."
"As mentioned in other critiques, and as this idea continues to be refined, some thought should be spent on the possibility of describing the history of book technology and in providing suggestions for where our digital reading technology is taking us. To be sure, printed books have been a critical factor in the advancement of mankind, but I think it would be nice to read more about some of the differences between what some of us may have experienced as children and what amazing options are for the children of today. Extend this into the future, and the possibilities become quite exciting indeed!"
It does show how things we did in the past are now improved or changed as a result of technological advances. I clearly understand the point the author is making and the writing is clearly thought-out.
"The field guide attempts to show the ability that technology has to instantly document our lives and save that documentation forever, without fear of it being lost due to some physical destruction. The problem is we spend most of the field guide learning about the authors time his/her brother uploaded their DNA online in order to map back potential members of their gene pool. While this is interesting it seems to fall short of the assigned task of finding a (a real book, object, publication, real or virtual thing), not something made up."
The field guide closely follows the prompt and finds a new type of way to engage with books through some sort of future or new technology. The guide explains the process of emerging existing texts into a more immersive reality and has made me want to download the app on mu iPhone.
The field guide describes Reddit very well and points out all the aspects of Reddit that make it something that answers the prompt's questions. The field guide creates even for someone who knows nothing about Reddit a well thought out description enabling them to use the site.
"While the Field Guide explains Reddit very well and enables the user of the guide to navigate the site with ease, its claims that Reddit is the future of books is a bit short sighted. While Reddit may be the future of DIY, self-help and information/resource based books, it will have a hard time treading in the rivers of fiction. Fiction is a huge aspect of books and text still and the Reddit community and the way the site is constructed would struggle in attempting to improve the fiction universe."
The selected thing from which the Field Guide is created follows the prompt perfectly. The description in the field guide explains what has changed in the books adaptation and these changes are a result in new technologies and advancements made.
I would really think of new ways in which ebooks can change like the way the one described in the field guide did. Instead of assuming that mainly a transition from paper to electronic format is all that will happen. Fill your future factor section with more of what you think is a possibility of the ebook.
"The technologies described definitely seem to provide a more immersive experience for the reader. Especially ""Alice,"" with its ability to provide a previously unheard of level of interactivity with the story itself. The selections point toward an emerging technology meant to work with the existing book itself to make it something new. It meets the challenges of the assignment by detailing how these products enhance the reading experience in a variety of ways (social, interactive, and reviews). It also hints toward how these technologies might be expanded upon in the future, to further change the reading experience."
The only place I can see that it falls short is that this entry is not actually about a book or something intended to replace a book. It is about a set of applications that essentially act as peripherals to a book. Similar to the way that video game system accessories add capability to the existing system. It would also have been nice to have a some information about the platforms on which these applications are currently available.
"This entry very effectively describes the ergodic text, ""House of Leaves,"" and how it utilizes unorthodox methods of story-telling to give voice to several characters. The features detailed make the prospect of reading a text of such innovative design very enticing. It is representative of how certain authors are now bushing the limitations of the traditional book to tell stories in a way few could have previously imagined."
"I do not believe this entry falls short. It effectively achieves its goal of describing this ergodic text and what books could look like in the future. I do, however, disagree that this text and those like it show the way forward for the book. I believe they are quite powerful as a novelty, as I believe printed books will become in the future. However, I don't believe they will go further than that and become an industry standard. It would be much more difficult for new authors overall to consistently produce multilayered content as a standard format. It would also get laborious for the reader and the format would no longer be unique. Ergodic literature can range from multilayered storytelling to works of art that use words as their medium. In order to remain as impressive as they are, they rely partially on the fact that the are so different from the traditional book. Additionally, while texts like these seem as though they would have to be produced as a physical book, that is not necessarily true either. A good example would be ""S."", by J.J. Abrams and Doug Dorst, as it is an ergodic text that is also available as an ebook and an audiobook."
"This sounds like an amazing companion to one of the, if not the, most popular book series' in history. The Harry Potter series enjoyed immense popularity before it ever graced a movie screen. There are few modern series' that have managed to hold the public attention in such large numbers for seven books and eight film adaptations. I can only imagine how immersive and how much fun this site would be for a Harry Potter fan. I think this description really gives the reader a sense of the level of content on the site. As well as several examples of the interesting and creative content they can expect to find when they visit it. For an fan, after reading that description, I can only imagine that their next stop would be Pottermore.com."
"Fair warning: This is my second review about this site. I feel this description did a very good job of highlighting the social features of the site and the additional literary content, in the form of fan fiction and the small additions from Rowling, which would definitely be a draw for any die hard Harry Potter fan. Combined with the continual development of additional story content in the games and the ability to stay in contact with J.K. Rowling herself. It definitely appears that Pottermore.com would be the number one place to go to immerse one's self in the Harry Potter universe."
"There is no clear connection to the idea that this is an evolution of the book, or something bound to replace the book. It is a website. A very in-depth site with many features, but it is still not a place where on can go and read the seven official Harry Potter texts or an innovation that delivers those stories in another way but in the same depth. It is a great resource for fans, but it is still reliant on the existence of the books, in basically their traditional form, one which to build this universe."
I believe you've made a strong point here about the similarity between documentary and informational text. There is a natural connection in the way that the information is delivered. Video in a how-to or documentary style may very well replace their textbook or informational text counterparts in the future. This is one of the few types of books I believe is on the way out.
"This entry goes in depth to explore how podcasts offer the same experience of reading a book but with the added benefit of being able to multi-task. It effectively explains what a podcast is, who uses them, and why they are important. It also uses several very specific examples to strengthen its assertions."
"The only suggestion I would have is to make mention of the millions of different types of podcasts are out there. There is truly a podcast for everybody. This would give readers a reason to seek out podcasts. I know a lot of people who are intimidated by them just because they don't understand what they are, or that there are podcasts out there that cater to their interests."
"This is an extremely well-written entry, with enough excellent description to make anybody want to read (or here, listen to) this story. It highlights a very relevant piece, one which blends the custom of stories with the ""second orality"" we are focusing on. The writer of this entry appeals to ""the illiterate and the bibliobibuli alike,"" stating the advantages of such a form of literature in the modern world. A great entry!"
"I've read and reread this entry trying to find something to suggest an improvement on, and I can't find it. This is a great entry and I think it accomplished everything it was meant to."
This is a very interesting take on the future of the book -- the focus on an interactive future is exciting. I think this entry presents an excellent argument for the futuristic digitalization of literature. It effectively describes the benefits of such technology and why it is an important option for our literary future.
"This entry wonderfully blends the arts of printed books and digital media, must like the subject itself. It is clear that the writer supports the idea of digital media as an enhancer of printed text, rather than a complete replacement, which is something I completely relate to. This entry effectively describes the content of the story without being over-revealing, and it describes the ways in which the story is a glimpse into the future of literature."
I think this entry does a great job of answering each of the questions and meeting the requirements of the assignment. I am absolutely inspired as a reader to experience this work for myself.
"I think this entry very effectively describes what makes ""Annarasumanara"" different from other e-texts, and therefore a ""future"" book rather than one we already know. The author picks out a specific characteristic of this web comic (the noticeably different format and disregard to the uniformity consistent with other web comics) to distinguish it from others and propose it as a futuristic text. It also gives readers an idea of what the web comic is about, and makes us curious to know more about the characters and story line."
"The only suggestion I might have is to focus a bit more on what makes this story special and different from anything we've ever read before, rather than on being so descriptive about the characters or parts of the story. I definitely do want to hear a little about the story line, but feel there is a little bit too much of it here. I want to learn about the characters' reasons for doing things by reading the web comic itself, rather than from a summary. But overall I think this entry makes an excellent case for ""Annarasumanara"" as a futuristic book!"
"I love your concept of the role playing book, and I do agree that this is already happen to an extent. I think it would help if you gave a specific book that this is already happening with, as I believe this was the assignment. 
 
 
 
 So here is where I know this is happening. James Frey's new book, I believe it is called EndGame, will include a mystery with hidden gold (?) I think and an app produced by Google, so people can solve the mystery, plan on the app, and solve the game. Here is a link: http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/comic-con-james-frey-introduce-719685
 
 
 
 Google Niantic labs makes Ingress, an interactive real world game which people have written many books about, where you are battling in the real world for I think access to power points or something?"
"Some of the other concepts presented are awesome and future-esque, but this is by far the most intensely future-esque concept presented! Very cool. I'm surprised I haven't heard about this more, as it sounds so revelatory.
 
 
 
 I think each of these concepts sounds so complicated, it might be easier to focus on just Alice at it was the one that caught your attention."
"Wow, the technologies I've critiqued thus far are crazy. I had no idea the ""future"" of the book was so advanced!
 
 
 
 This is a great choice of technology to feature, as it is obviously right on the pulse of the future.
 
 
 
 I like how you mention the possibilities with children quite a bit, as I think that is important, I know many children who already use iPads as reading tools and I can definitely see this as a possibility in the future.
 
 
 
 You also managed to explain everything in an eloquent way, there weren't any grammar errors in your writing that I could find, so great job on that as you are talking about some complicated tech topics here."
"I think what I'm missing here, from the title down, is a clear and brief description of what augmented reality is or how it works. Are there glasses? What makes it different than how I use my iPhone or iPad now? The pictures become 3D when I look at my iPad? I point my iPad at a picture? Where is the picture, what do I point at the iPad, my eyes or the picture? I guess for the non-techie, that aspect lost me. Just a slower, more clear description of the process of reading in this augmented reality. I pick up my iPad, and then what happens? Is there text on the screen, or only pictures? 
 
 
 
 What are QR codes? I would leave that part out, and focus on explaining the process of reading this sort of book like you're talking to someone who only reads hardback novels, and has no idea about the tech world. Just walk them through the experience. I'm a fan of making things really simple.
 
 
 
 And for some reason your title shows up as ""Untitled 341,"" but then you have a subtitle? So I'm not sure what happened there, if that was a glitch in the system or something."
"The entry strengths are good because it explains how The secret lives of Men and Women can attract to people who want rather read from the internet. It challenges the assignment because it provides reasoning on why this would be the future book, such as how people adapt to social media and how this future book can relate to it."
"I think that the entry fell short on providing more reasoning as to why it will be a future book, and I would suggest to explain more about it."
The entry strengths are the detail explanation about the book. It meets the challenge of the assignment because it discuss and explains how this book can be a future book.
"I think that the entry falls short in the reader not understanding the reason this book can be the future book, It give the reader many explanation about but not very well convincing. I think that it needs to be more convincing as to why this can be a future cook."
The reader gets a full understanding of what is being describe to be the future book. It meets the challenge of the assignment because it is explained and gives a good knowledge about why the role playing game and choose your own adventure game can be the future book.
I think that this entry had good supporting information as to why it can be a future book. I think that the reader was convinced and maybe provide more information in proving the point of why it is the future book.
I really think this post was good because it provided the book information in details and that it was an ebook. It met the challenge of the assignment because their was enough information to convince the reader about the future book and why it could be.
"I think that the entry did not fall short and that its was well written with enough information for the reader to be convince. The only feedback would be about the font, It was not the regular font which is New Times Roman, that should be changed."
The strengths can be found in that there was a lot of good detail information to why the digital book is the future. It met the challenge of the assignment in proving reasons as to how the digital books will be the future books due to modern technology.
The author certainly supports that podcasts are a way forward for creative works. There are a number of outside sources within the Field Guide that support the idea that podcasts and recorded audio work in general could surpass the written word as a way to consume both fiction and non-fiction.
"The author does an excellent job in summarizing the appeal of the novel itself. In addition, the way the book is created, with crowdsourced financing and increased interaction between audience and author, is a compelling way forward for future publications."
"The author does an excellent job at describing the uniqueness of the work itself, as well as the visual style of the art. The ability to alter or eliminate the restrictions of the printed page is well-explained in how the work takes advantage of the lack of limitation in electronic form."
"This field guide entry does an excellent job in explaining Tumblr and how it can be used by authors and artists to distribute their craft. It also demonstrates how this can be effective in a changing electronic landscape, incorporating both multiple forms of media and reader-response into an ongoing product."
"In this case, the author focuses on a technology, rather than a specific work. I believe that to properly fulfill the assignment, the guide should be refocused on a particular work that uses Tumblr as the medium, and use examples from that work to demonstrate how Tumblr is different from other mediums. While one author is mentioned as an example, the field guide would be stronger if it were focused on the work, rather than the technology."
"The author does an excellent job focusing on a single work and expanding on the method that work uses in order to demonstrate how this can be used for a variety of works. Each aspect of the expanded website is well-explained and clear, and it's easy to see how this is a useful tool to expand the world of the novel."
"I love the way you portrayed the ongoing relationship a blog can establish between author and reader in theFuture Factor section and how it differs from that of a novel. You did a great job in your description as well, and made a compelling case as to why a blog can be considered afuture book."
"You did an excellent job with this assignment. Your descriptions were very clear and you made a compelling case as to why Pottermore is afuture book. I had never heard of it and you made me want to go check it out myself. You have a great tone to your writing that made your entry enjoyable to read. I love your last line and the idea of technology as a tool tofeed the fans, great imagery (and very accurate I believe). Fans are always hungry for more and are constantly searching for new ways to feed that hunger. Technology offers a great way for fans to connect with the author, as well as other people who have the same interests."
"I loved your entry! It was thoughtful and very creative. You have a great tone that makes your writing enjoyable to read. I loved the way you described the aesthetics of the book, invisible like a ghost. I also liked that you included Gaimans Halloween gift-giving tradition. That history gives the work more solidity. You did a great job in your description and made me want to go download it immediately. You also made a compelling case as to why this is aFuture Book. 
 
 Bibliobibuli is a great word by the way, I actually had to look that one up :)"
This was a great entry. Your description was excellent and by far your greatest strength in this assignment. It was very detailed and I could clearly imagine the book in my head.
"This was certainly the most creative idea I've read. The idea that we are all stories is one that I firmly believe. It's a great concept. I like the way you portrayed all the footprints we are creating through photographs, videos, facebook, twitter, instagram, etc. Our great grandchildren will have a far more accurate account of our story than we have of our own great grandparents. What I also like about this concept is that our stories never really end. Our story is part of our parents' story and our friends' stories and many other stories that are constantly overlapping and weaving together throughout the years."
"This entry provides a detailed account of the author's ""future"" book."
"This entry was very interesting, particularly for those who are interested in science fiction novels. The description of the book's synopsis is what makes it really captivating. The student started their description with a question bringing the reader in as if we were reading the back cover of the book."
"It was a very good entry with very little I can find wrong. The future factor is well described and I feel I have a grasp on what Unbound is all about. Additionally, the student explained why this way of writing publishing could be popular in the future. The student also gave us a taste of what his/her full field entry will look like with a clear and well lit picture. I suppose if I wanted to see anything more, it would be more about the history/inspiration of the book."
"This entry is actually very realistic and makes a convincing argument for the popularity of orality over reading with examples of existing podcasts and other media today. Similarly, although the future factor contains a lot of hypotheses there seems to be enough realism to make it believable such the expense of printing and digital."
"The students gives a wonderfully detailed description of his/her future book. The format was thoroughly explained enough for me to understand what I would be getting into without the student actually giving away the story. The student also made a great point in their future factor about how creative format books such as ""House of Leaves"" would not be able to be e-books or digitized."
The student has provided sufficient background for his/her future book as well as a convincing and believable argument as to why the format for such a book will become even more popular.
"The part about ""Alice"" met the challenge of the Assignment. I liked the idea of being in Hogwarts and walking around and looking at notes! Maybe the author could set these scenarios up in such a way that the curious are rewarded."
A very spirited campaign for the blog! I could see how reading a blog could approximate the book-reading experience for you.
"But will the blog replace the book? I see them co-existing as they do presently, but unless blogs progress in some way, I am not seeing the ""future book"" part."
Description was strong. Many good points and examples. I listen to podcasts often while working myself.
This was a great example of a story in a new-ish format. It made me interested in seeing and reading the comic!
"Not sure how this is the future if it is now...? Also, can it be read on a phone or is size sometimes still a consideration for this format?"
I think the subject of the field guide was well chosen. This is an interesting competitor in a very new and exciting space. You did a great job of conveying the sense of newness and excitement for the 3 different programs. I agree that interacting with books in the future could be heading in this direction.
This entry highlights a very recent innovation. The case for this being futuristic is easy to make. I don't think it is a stretch to anticipate an increase in supporting content for novels. I agree that we will very likely see more of this type of interactive website in the future.
"This entry provides a strong sense of what is means to be a future-ready book. I agree with the sentiment that readers in the future will want increased speed, technology, and convenience. The ebook or hybrid book definitely fits the speed, technology, and convenient requirement nicely."
"I love the connection to video games. Video games are growing in such a huge way that it would be easy to conceive of a distant future where movies, TV, and even literature take inspiration from them. This is a very fun and futuristic vision."
This entry falls short in providing an actual example of this particular hybrid ebook. I think a field guide should focus on one example and describe the execution in detail.
Excellent future factor! I have a few friends that hate reading and have switched exclusively to audio books(where possible). I have yet to listen to one but it is clear that this type of format is already catching on. Your particular entry sounds like an improvement on the traditional audio book. Good job.
"This entry focused on the Ideo, a really innovative technology. This entry delves into the specifics of Ideo, and the different concepts that they have developed. It is well-written, and a thoughtful post. It meets the challenges of the assignment by examining such an innovative concept."
"This entry could focus a little bit more on the history of the book, and how e-readers fall into the development of the book. Furthermore, the author could touch on the ways in which people interact with e-readers today."
"I really enjoyed this entry's selection for the assignment. It was innovative and interesting. The author takes a unique perspective by examining the children's book. As children thrive on constant stimulation, electronic devices are great for kids."
"This entry does an excellent job at incorporating images and text. The author clearly thought about this assignment, and the work is very well-written. The author selected an unique text, and successfully described the book's elements."
"This entry could delve into the history of the book, and how this is represents the future of the book. The assignment called for what happens in 1000 to 5000 years, so perhaps a more complete picture of what makes this ""futuristic"" is necessary."
"This entry's strength lie in the last section. The production of the book is what makes it futuristic, and it is a coincident that the book also happens to be about the future. The author was also able to include an image, which makes the post stronger. The description section was written very creatively and sounded like something you would read off the back of the book."
"This entry's strength is in thinking outside of the box. I would have never examined a Post Secret book in a futuristic manner, but I understand the logic behind it after reading this entry. This author has a detailed explanation of postsecret.com that aides in understanding the concept. Overall, it is well-written."
This entry clearly defines the Pottermore website and its attributes as an extension of the Rowling series of books. It definitely could be viewed as a futuristic technological leap for books especially this type of story that has an epic quality too it and multiple books contained within a single story line.
"There are quite a few editing errors that need to be made throughout the draft. A close reading should catch them. Otherwise, this site sounds like an interesting website for those interested in the Harry Potter series."
The author clearly describes the book in great detail as far as its physical look and appearance and gives a good comparison helping the audience understand somewhat what scanimation is.
"There are some minor editing errors that should be seen on a slow re-reading of the entry. Additionally, I was a little bit confused on the concept of scanimation. The author of the entry gives a comparison but I find myself still struggling to see the futuristic qualities of the book. The book sounds like it fits the bill to a futuristic book but also just sounds like a picture a book. Perhaps a little more explanation of scanimation would explain the book better."
"I love how the author of the entry describes all the parts of the book that make it futuristic. It sounds like the book using the internet in a major way to tell the story and this integration of literature and internet technology definitely speaks to a the future direction of books. It sounds like a great read, I'll have to check out."
The author of this entry perhaps goes to far in re-telling the entire plot of the book. The entry is incredibly long and quite possibly far over the 500 word limit. A tighter description of the futuristic qualities of the book and a lot less plot telling would make the entry more successful as a field study guide. Right now it reads more like a book report.
"This entry does a great job of capturing the futuristic essence of ""The House of Leaves."" There is great descriptions and focus on the formatting of the text in the story. This appears to be the greatest example of the book's author's forward and futuristic thinking. This too, sounds like a great read."
There really isn't much to critique in the negative of this entry.
"This entry does really great at explaining hybrid books and how they are a potential future book type. However, this wasn't the assignment. There isn't a clearly chosen book that is being described just an idea of a book type/genre."
This entry doesn't describe an actual book. It merely covers the idea of what a successful future book would look like. The assignment was to find a book that speaks towards the future and describe it's merits as a future book. This entry doesn't do this at all.
"The strength in this entry is definitely the hard fact that this concept and company are brand new to most of us reading the entry. The description and use of persuasive language in the description was exceptional. It made me want to watch the video for a second time.
 
 This meets the challenge of the assignment because it is simply an actual attempt at a company predicting the trajectory of where the future of the book will be."
The problem that had me questioning whether it would work as an entry was the fact that two of the three products were things that surrounded and enhanced the use of a book or ebook. I might focus on the last company(?) that actually altered the way we would read books.
"The strength in this entry is the third section which explains the ""future factor"". While the actual product might not interest me completely, the explanation as to how it represents how we as readers can interact with a story in different ways made me want to check this story out to at least experience the different mediums. 
 
 This entry meets the challenge of the assignment because it provides us with an actual product that is being used by authors and readers today, but is only a glimpse into what is possible in this new technology."
The formatting is a little bit confusing. I could not tell if there were parts that were quotes from the actual links provided.
There are a few grammatical errors in the entry that caused me to have to reread the sentence.
"The strength of this entry is the writers passion for reddit. The writer seems very invested in this particular website, and states very vehemently that this site is already replacing books. 
 
 The entry meets the challenge because it is one of the specified examples in the assignment description."
"This entry's strength is it's description of the technology. While this is the second entry to describe a technology that interacts with books in the form of an app, it explains the technology in a way that I am able to picture in my mind.
 
 This meets the challenge of the assignment because it introduces the readers to a new way to interact with printed books."
"The strengths are definitely the added images. This is something that I forgot about in my assignment, and none of the other reviews that I'm doing are for entries that include pictures at all. I think that this entry did an excellent job enticing me to read the book. I agree that Pessl's ""Night Film"" can be described as a future book because of the extrasensory details that the book includes in order to involve the reader in the story.
 
 
 
 I think it meets the challenge of the assignment because it has expertly addressed every aspect of the project and made me want to go out and read this book!"
"I would have been interested to read an entry about something other than the style of books that we've already been reading in class, which is what I felt this entry felt like. I don't really have anything else to suggest, I think this article was done really well and its the best one that I reviewed!"
"This entry meets the challenge of the assignment because I believe that it is a representation of a future book, albeit for personal reasons only."
"This entry is not for something that I think everyone can relate to, nor is it something that I think everyone would be interested. I do believe that this is an example of a future book, but I think this entry falls short in every other aspect. I appreciate the fact that this is a more personal example, but I don't think it fits the assignment.
 
 
 
 I think that this can be improved by choosing a topic that everyone can relate to. This is a narrow topic of an example of a future book for one individual, but not for everyone. In this scenario I'm still seeing people having to go out and buy books instead of having easier access to them like ebooks."
"I think that the author of this entry was feeling very strong about the book that s/he chose. This allowed for a more passionate feeling about the book which makes the reader of this entry want to read the book and to see the accompanying film and apps! I think its really cool that this book has other platforms that go along with it aside from just different pictures like we saw in ""A Dodo at Oxford"". This ties the book to more recent modes of media which I found very interesting."
"If anything, I felt like this could have used more detail in order to make it a little bit longer. The length and the voice of the entry didn't seem to go hand in hand. I felt the passion that was coming through in the writing, but then it ended before I wanted to."
I think the subject of this entry is very interesting and is something that I would enjoy taking a look at. Its also a reference to some iconic pop culture which I think will still be relevant in the future. I think this meets the challenge of the assignment because it ties together the past and the future in a way that I think could be relevant for anyone.
"This entry is about documentaries with a primary focus on the ""Babies"" documentary film. I liked this entry because I felt like it gave a different spin on the project while still meeting the assignment. This is definitely an example of the future of the book. I could see people in the future choosing to watch documentaries to learn about things instead of reading books. As it is, things like furniture and special dog collars already come with DVDs to show you how to use them correctly."
"I think the piece is off to a very good start, in general I think there are just a few places that could be expanded upon with some greater detail. As the author mentions the presentation of the book is unique as an audio book, so in addition the description of Gaiman's voice as the author has done which is very well done, the argument would benefit from describing how that unique experience of being read to instead of reading; not being separated from the author by your own voice, pacing, and tone of reading, or physical page, but instead almost having a ""tangible"" connection to the author and the authors voice changes the reading experience as only an audio book can. Doing so would help to further drive home the point that audio books are a entirely unique experience. I would have also like to have a scene a little bit of a deeper analysis on how audio books could expand reading in the future - again, drive home the point that this format can uniquely change the reading experience over other mediums, not just save time as the author rightfully mentioned."
"I specifically thought the description that focused on the Alice program was direct, easy to follow and clearly showed how the program furthered the reading experience through an immersive experience for the reader - it was the most effective and impactful description and really showed how books can incorporate future technology in order to evolve."
"Because the programs are very unique and many readers could be unfamiliar with their concepts I feel that the first two programs, Nelson and Coupland could have benefitted from an expanded description. I understand that the limited word space requires succinct phrasing, and the current descriptions do a fine job of describing the programs actual functions, but specific examples of something a reader could do while using the app (instead of just describing general functions) and how it would benefit the reader might have clarified the apps purpose and place in the future of the book, making the description a bit easier to understand, especially to those who are unfamiliar with the programs."
"I greatly appreciated the use of senses to describe the unique elements of the website in the description section - I also wrote about Pottermore and that was not something I had thought about including in my own description but it really helped to sell the complete atmosphere the site provides not just in content but all the way to its attention to ambiance, which is something unique to web and audio formats that can not be included in the book. The sensory details helped set the stage for the following descriptions of the types of activities users can participate in on the site, helping to show how immersive and expansive the site is and truly showing how individual it is. The summary is also very clear and direct, the reader knows exactly what the entry will be about and what to expect in the following sections."
"I thought the description of just what makes Pottermore a future book was well crafted and straight to the point. Not only did it show how it represents something new in the formatting and use of books by explaining the interactive websites use as a digital extension of the printed world to be used in conjunction with the books, but it mentioned why this was successful - people depend upon technology. In the other posts I have read, not many authors focused on why their type of book was sustainable and successful for the future of books; this post did in an well though out sentence. Such an explanation helps to solidify the potential of this type of medium and why it could feasibly be incorporated into other books and other genres as people become more and more familiar with and dependent upon technology."
"I thought the focus on the emotional reaction of the reader based on the text was intriguing and a very interesting way to show readers that the future of the books does not necessarily have to involve technology in a traditional way. The descriptions of the multiple formats and uses of texts (and their purposes) truly showed not only the versatility of font and format, but its importance, and just how deeply the presentation of words in a story can effect the readers emotional well being or reflect the state of the character or the world of the book in a visceral way. The idea that the technological advances of books does not have to mean their conversion to ebooks or their forced incorporation of technology was interesting and well presented."
"While the description of the types of fonts and formats is well presented and well reasoned, if feel including more detail of just how the use of those tools effects the emotional response/connection to the work of the reader would have helped sell the appeal of this type of book more. By just focusing on the detailed and complex uses of the font and format (while informative, important and well done in the original post) the book can come off as daunting or confusing, which may work for some readers, but in general feels like a hard sell to get people interested. By incorporating how those techniques create a unique and intriguing experience for the reader however, and why that experience of House of Leaves is unique, people might be far more willing to go into the book with an open mind and spirit and not be turned off to the idea of this type of media in general."
The strength of your rough draft is that you explained the usages of a blog very thoroughly and what a blog encompasses.
"Unless I read the title of your subject, I would not have understood what you were necessarily writing about, I kept waiting to read which particularblog you were discussing, however, you were speaking generally about blogs as a whole. Possibly bring up an example of a blog group that you have found very useful or interesting so that the reader could be directed to those and they could experience what you are describing. You spoke of tragedies, possibly reference where you read about a child drowning or cancer that struck you so interesting that you mentioned it here."
"The strength of your draft are that you clearly describe the journey of Emily C. chronologically detailing her story as a vegan, among other aspects of that such as including recipes. I also found it strong that you mentioned howe-books are the wave of the future and the items that are now extinct that once captured memories."
The strength of your article is that you clearly described the benefits of a hybrid book and contrasted it with an actual book to where I could understand why you would prefer a hybrid book.
"The weakness of your article would be several grammatical errors, however I understood and followed what you were saying with no problem. I think your article could have had more bearing if you described one particular hybrid book."
"The strengths of your Rough Draft are that you explained thoroughly an internet news community to where I did look it up, I had never heard of it before. The problem with the claim that this is ""already the future of the internet"" is that there are so many communities of information, it is sometimes difficult to decipher which carries the most accurate information. However, you could be very right, all the information we now receive is from sources that are not well known, and are put on by anyone, so that is accurate. You did a great job of striking my interest, so, as I said, I did look up your source and I will definitely look at it again for some information."
"The only thing that I would offer as a grammatical change is to not begin a paragraph with the word ""it"". Everything was wonderful as far else as I could see. The entire assignment flowed very well and was interesting."
"Your strength in your rough draft was that you kept my interest and I desired to look up the site that you cited. Everything flowed very well and I think this is an exciting way to jump off from a book into the technology aspect, as not everyone has a computer, but if they desire to go farther than a book, they have the option to do so. Our discussion boards are very similar, as gaining insight from each other aids in our learning and understanding. You taught me something with this, as I did not know it even existed, my mother still goes to book clubs at the local library, and this would definitely prove more convenient."
"I did not find any weaknesses in your paper, as I stated previously, everything flowed very well and you held my interest."
"The motion does match the description I suppose, although I don't get the sense that the square is walking or running. It honestly just looks like it is tweeking out. The object does change colors though when its speed changes. Aesthetically, I think the program is quite pleasing."
The motion matches the description from everything that I can see. However I believe we were told to come up with some sort of description that was more story-related. In this case maybe the walker is a person with paranoia who runs when he thinks something is coming after him. Otherwise this sketch does what it is described and I love the screen wrapping.
Motion depicts the description ! running period can be increased to make it distinct.the difference between walking and running will be more noticeable apart from color change.
"The description matches the patch exactly. Great job, I like the idea of it being a bird."
"Yes, the motion does the description of the behavior of Question 2. The ""bird"" does fall blue, and then flies and goes green. However, the motion is not contained in the window, so instead of falling to the ground, it's a loop of the ""bird"" falling."
"Yes, the motion matches the description. I see the blue as the bird falls and then the green rotating rectangle as it tries to fly, then the motion is repeated on a loop."
"Yes, the motion matches. But I am not sure what ""moves East"" means; it appears to move in a random direction when it tries to fly. But the way that the majority of the distance traveled while falling is straight down with only small variation is realistic for a free fall."
The motion matches the description very well as it definitely seems like a bird is continually falling and trying to fly. the different states do a fine job to mimic this.
"The motion matched the description very well. After reading the description, I felt that the different rectangles became different people. Their movement were unique and vivid that gave the ""street""(the window) life. Also he used different color changed when a new column of rectangle showed up. Very impressive."
"Yes, because the squares are moving in the upward direction but stopping every now and then to ""sidestep"" and then continue in the upward direction."
"The movement more or less matches the description, although it seems this person is stuck walking in a VERY crowded area. Maybe Time Square."
"The description does match the behavior, but I find it hard to see it as a rocket. When the rocket teleports back the bottom and changes color it seems like it is a separate object. If the the rocket were to bounce of the walls I think the piece would make more sense."
"It matches. The rectangle moves very slowly for 3 seconds and then starts moving fast. When it exceeds the top, it appears again at the bottom and changes a color."
"I think the description of your sketch is pretty accurate. It reminds me of fireworks rather than rockets, with all that changing colors. However, the only thing that threw me off was the mousePressed action. When I click on the screen, the trail disappears, and it doesn't seem like a rocket/fireworks anymore. Other than that, good job on the sketch!"
"The motion satisfies the purpose of the assignment, though there are no constraints to limit its movement inside the screen."
"Yes, the description matches the animation perfectly."
"Yes the sketch does match the description above for this project. I think this is a great project that had a lot of effort put into it, and the objects really do look like butterflies with various rectangle shapes fluttering around and ""showing up"" one right after the other. They do stay within a small access, while still fluttering randomly."
The description matches the general behavior of the sketch although I think there could have been more details. In addition to their description the butterflies were changing color and leaving a trail.
Haha! This is awesome and very creative. Their movements are very much like butterflies. motion matches the description.
"Yes. The motion matches the description. I liked the description, it was funny. The rectangle does exactly as it says, staggering to the exit."
"It matches. Once the program starts to run, the walker starts to walk towards the bottom-left corner, kinda staggered. But it's not clear if the robot, after reaching the bottom-left corner, stops at that particular position or just moves out side of the window."
"Yes it does, however I think it's Elvis ghost moving southwest because it looks very faint/ghostly the way it moves, but I loved the way that they described the movement. It moves southwest because of (-2, 1) in their code making it take the quickest exit instead of using other ""routes"" or coordinates. It also has that jumpy/zig-zag movement because it randomly jumps between (+/- 4 pixels left; +/- 2 pixels down)."
The animation matches the description and I think the changing colors as the direction changes is also a very nice touch. It matches the behavior in that the walker goes straight then changes direction as it hits a wall.
"The description of the sketch accurately describes the motion of the object. I feel it's ironic though that the Rumba leaves behind a trail of ""paint"" instead of cleaning."
"Yes it does, it walks forward and then bounces off of the walls. I like that you used random with the colors, it makes an interesting design as it builds upon itself."
"Yes, the motion does match the description of the behavior. I like how it changes color to indicate a different line is being walked by ""the blind person"" every time they bump into a wall. Or even the Rumba description is spot on with your code."
"I do recognize the rumba motion. It's a little bit too slow for demonstration purposes, but it's pretty accurate. Good job."
The both the creative description and coding description match exactly with what is occurring in this code. It is a fun description and the amount of detail you used in both explanations is very well done.
The motion does match the description very well as it does seem to mimic two painters competing to color one canvas. They do walk extremely fast which makes the dashing of the bright guy a bit hard to see but you can tell that it is there and more prominent than the sad painter.
"Yes, the cool walker does move more vertically and the warm walker moves more horizontally. They both stay in the box and move about randomly and quickly."
"Yep. Sometimes the walkers move so fast they are a bit hard to follow, but their behavior matches the description."
The motion matches the description in Question 2 because the character overlap constantly with their consistent colors.
"Yes, the description matches the motion well. The red, raging parolee frantically paces in his home, quickly filling all the available space. Then it bolts from the home. It is a very nice looking animation, and becomes pretty funny when the story is told."
"Yes, the motion matches the description. The rectangle moves but stays within a confined area at the center of the screen. After a period of time it begins to move randomly outside of that area. The color changes from a light to dark red while trapped, then from a light to dark cyan when free. It could have been programmed to continue walking randomly on an infinite loop once free, instead of stopping or moving outside the screen."
The animation clearly shows that someone is pacing back and forth which perfectly resembles someone who is on house arrest.
Yes because the rectangles are all centered in the window and continues to stay in that area for a considerable amount of time.
"The motion represented by the sketch matched the description of behavior in the assignment. The walker would turn more and more red each frame that progressed, until the 30 seconds were up. As soon as the time was up, the walker started to turn cyan like it was supposed to. It also started going around, but at a certain point, it went off screen and I didn't see it again."
The behavior seems to exhibit the described actions just fine.
"The motion does match the description, but the description seems a little vague. It does speed up and slow down like the author describes. The animation is also a bit boring to look at. Don't be afraid to add color."
I cant really see that its speeding up or slowing down. You said you wanted it to pop up on the other side of the window if it went out of bound and it did do that.
"Yes. The motion matches the description. It starts slow, speeds up, slows, speeds up... It worked exactly how it is described."
For the most part yes because the rectangles seem to speed off after some time but then tend to cluster for a bit as well.
"Yes, it sort of reminded me of fireworks, the way it explodes for 4 seconds and fireworks sort of leave a trail of smoke after it's done and then you have to load up the next firework so it stays in it's spot for 2 seconds and waits for it to be shot up."
The patch matches the description very well. Awesome job.
It seems match the description. I can see both the rotation and the moving of the walker. But I'd like to see which kind of character does this walker looks like.
"It really does. Mainly talking about the end there, you don't need an explanation to see that it looks like bubbly water spouting out from the ground. Nicely done."
"The motion of the sketch is as described in question 2. The rectangle draws itself a couple of times around on the screen and skips to the middle of the screen then repeats again. However, what the description says about the duration of each behavior is a bit off by a couple of seconds. The rectangle moves around for about 1 to 2 seconds and then draws in the middle of the screen for less than 1 second."
The movement is a cool and funny one and it meets all the requirements.
It sure does match it. The description is pretty clever and fitting to what I saw. Good job!
"Yes. The walker acts normal within a specific area until prompted, and then returns to normal afterwards. I like the mouse movement incorporation."
"I think this patch excellently mimics the description given. Upon reading the description I was a bit skeptical as to whether or not it would look like the motion. But when loading the patch, it fits it very well and is also extremely entertaining to interact with."
"I sort of see it. It's very quick on how it reacted to seeing a celebrity, but it seems calm most of the time. It looks like the walker object continues going in random directions and it doesn't head back to its cosy little area."
This is one of my favorites; it's very different. You did a really good job depicting the fluttering wings and the basic movement of a fly. Good job.
"Yes, the motion matches the description well. It is obviously a fly. While sometimes the fly flies backwards, the twitchy erratic flight and the size changes really sell it."
The sketch exhibits the described behavior very well.
Yes. The motion described is performed by the rectangle.
"Yes it does match the description above. The lines of squares are moving from the top to the bottom right corner looking like a lightening bolt. I also like the transparent blue that they made. When I clicked the mouse and held it down the squares turned red, but when I released it went back to blue."
"The actions of the walker are described well, my only suggestion is when the walker goes off screen have it come through the other sider and not towards the middle."
"The walker matches the description, but seems almost identical to the example given in class that had the walker tend to travel right. The only difference in the actual movement is that instead of wrapping the screen cleanly, there is a 400 pixel gap that the walker won't travel. Also, you do not describe how you coded any of it, so it appears that you just took the class example and made a few minor aesthetic changes."
It kind of looks like it. It is just really hard for me to get past that they are just squares(or rectangles). But it does what it was supposed to do.
The walker matches the behavior in that it stays still while moving slightly for a while before 'jumping' to a close by area. With the strokeWeight it gives the walker a cool fading effect that adds to the jumping idea.
Good job! The walker matches the description very well. It moves in a small area for a short while and then jumps to a new spot on the screen. It was obvious that the code was original and easy to understand.
Yes. The character seems to move in any direction and it also returns to the center when it goes out of the 500x500 boundry.
"Yes, it does create the look of hand drawn spirals. I thought your use of expanding the radius was neat."
"Description and actual sketch look to be matching, but it's not described as if it was a character in a movie.
 
 This is also a really cool design. Great job!"
The crazy colorful motions do match the description you gave for your walkers behavior.
"Yes, it does, I like how you were able to use the millis(), I had a hard time understanding how to make that work."
"The motion described is actually described pretty well, and with your description it actually made the program come alive more than it normally would. You used the colors of the rect to help the viewer go deeper into your narrative, and it helps the viewers imagination create a world in their own heads using your sketch, This is a good mix of art and programming."
"Yes, it does seem like the walker is running around before circling in the same spot then running around randomly again."
"The assignment matches the description, it works well in that the rapid movements are done with larger squares while the smaller circling movements are matched with smaller squares."
"The sketch was quite unexpected. I had expected a large rectangle travelling down the screen and found one that was small and nearly transparent. However, I like how well it matches the actions of a parachute explorer. The response in question 2 matches the behavior of the rectangle as like that of the parachute explorer, giving me a better sense of what is happening on the screen."
Felt like I just had opened a pop up window on the internet inviting me to play a game.
"This patch is very similar to that of the patch we went over in class. The good key and bad key branches are the same with two sfplay~ messages, two meters, two ezdac~ messages, minus the different sounds that correspond to each of them. There is also a comment box that says ASCII value for the intended ASCII number code."
The way how this patch was approached was the same way as the patch that we went over in class. Something that was different that I saw was the addition of the comment speech bubble. I did not know that that was a way that comments can be presented and is definitely something that I learned.
The patch is very simple and it's easy to understand the signal flow.
"There is nothing technically wrong with the patch, however, the patch only needs one sound control, you don't need a second exdac object."
It is very simple and not particularly interesting in any way. I am somewhat bored by the simple sounds.
The patch looks very clean and well put together.
"The patch is impressive and works well, I think that they even added in some extra steps along the way that made the patch even a little cooler."
"The patch feels simple and clean, seemingly trying to be easily understood rather than technically efficient."
"It feels great to use. The sounds are simple and quick, making it easy to identify what key I've hit. The sounds end quickly which gives enough of a response to know if I hit the right key or not."
"The patch uses two different sfplay~ objects, one for success and one for failure, which makes the patch look easier to understand even if not as technically efficient. I've learned that simplicity can come from making it technically less simple, although it's not surprising or exciting. I am not sure what could have been done better."
The patch looks simple and logical.
"The experience is simple and mechanical with little conceptual salience, but there's still a sense of elementary investment in the patch's function. I'm happy when I hear the ""success"" song instead of the ""failure"" song."
"There isn't any major technical innovation here, but everything works fine."
The look of the patch is very organized and easy to understand.
Very simple and easy to read vertically from top to bottom. Same as in class.
"The patch looked very nice and professional. It seemed to contain all the correct pieces and buttons so based on appearance, I would give it an A."
"I thought the sounds were very creative. Now I had my volume on super loud so my first press and the ""W"" key was a bit shocking but after the initial shock I was good. The sounds themselves were actual song pieces which I really enjoyed. It was entertaining, energetic, and I would have fun playing around with this patch."
"This particular patch looks very professional to me. It is as cleaned up as it can be. As I have said, I did enjoy the fact that they added songs in place of a voice for the yes and no key. Did I learn how it was done based on the patch itself, no. However, I am no eager to do so. Honestly, there is not much more to be done to this patch to perfect it. It's self explanatory and easy as can be."
The patch was simple and easy to navigate. The sounds are entertaining.
I found the coding to be basically the same as shown in class. The two extra switches I thought maybe could have been removed. The sound was original as well.
"The patch appears to be very nice, and well put together."
The patch works fine and emits both a yes and a no sound.
When getting the right key it plays a sound very similar but more inviting then when hitting the wrong key.
The bad key has that weird ambient noise and good key is more like an electronic music tone.
The patch is good it takes two different types of sound to play which is a good mix.
this is a good patch it combines two different type of sound and its cool to listen to.
"This patch is another short and simple patch but i feel like it needs more room to be able to see more clearly, since it is a short assignment it does not hurt to spread them out a bit more."
The buttons used are great and they get the job done right with the sounds. The no sound is a simple gong which is better than just saying no and the yes button is cheerful music like the type you receive when you beat a level in a video game.
The program worked perfectly and it was interesting to hear different sounds and nothing repetitive. All they have to do is spread their projects out more in future projects.
This patch was very clean and put together nicely. All components were accurately described and neatly placed.
It's very simple. Text states clearly how to make the patch function and what it will do.
"It's entertaining. The laughter provokes memories. The ""bad key"" is kind of creepy while the ""good key"" is humorous."
Pretty simple patch. Not complicated to look at.
It was just like the example in class.
"Very entertaining to use, made me laugh just like the patch did, and it was easy to tell which key was the odd one out."
"The audio was the most surprising thing, most of the patch looked similar to the class example but it was the audio that made it unique."
It's pretty basic and straightforward. Lots of notes to let you know what's going on. Simple.
"When I first hit a ""wrong"" key, I thought I'd hit a ""right"" one, in that the sound of the evil laugh seemed so much more final than the Bevis and Butthead one. The whole thing felt a little goofy, but that's to be expected in a design that's all laughs."
"The whole thing was incredibly straightforward. I'd have preferred something a little more out of the box, particularly when we were given some degree of freedom. It works exactly how it was assigned, and I feel it's a little boring."
The look and feel is simple.
"The ""no"" sound was startling, and the ""yes"" sound was comedic and nice to hear."
"The ""yes"" key wasn't a letter, but a number key, which I thought was interesting."
The patch looks similar to the patch made in class. It feels generic.
"This student approached the assignment seemingly to complete it without adding anything new or special, so there is nothing surprising or exciting. I didn't learn anything, as it wasn't unique compared to what we have done in class. It's hard to say what could have been done better since we haven't learned much in class."
Looks and feels very similar to the patch built in class.
the good key sound is very entertaining.
the formula shown in class was used in this assignment.
"Before even using the patch, I could tell that program would run smoothly. It was well laid out and designed, nice and clean."
"The patch technically speaking was basically the same layout as instructed in class. However, they did a good job overall. I especially liked the sound files."
The buzzer sound for hitting the wrong key was really loud and annoying to hear over and over again.
"Technically, the patch worked perfectly, but there was nothing exciting about it."
"It's a very simple lay out. Very bare bones, and minimalistic. No real explanations to what everything does, outside of the 'good' and 'bad' buttons, but the path to each part if pretty easy to figure out."
the victory sound was a bit too long. but i felt like i watching a movie intro or playing a game
it was pretty simple only thing i would have done differently would be shortening the victory sound file
"The patch is very clean, everything is laid out in straight lines and is extremely easy to understand. There are no unnecessary elements in the patch."
"The bad key sound is extremely annoying so it really makes you want to find the right button quickly. I also liked how the good key's sound went on for a rather long time. It gave me a sort of Super Mario feel, similar to when the game is beaten and the credits start to roll."
They didn't do anything exciting or surprising but they made the patch as simplistic as possible and I almost think that's better than any extra elements. It makes it so the patch is very easy to read and the user can understand everything that's taking place.
"It's a very simple patch, it's easy to understand the signal flow."
"The failure sound is really annoying, I suppose that it makes the user more motivated to find the success sound, but the game requires hearing the fail sound over and over. It would be better if it was a softer, shorter, less annoying sound, or had volume controls so I don't have to endure it."
"This patch is very simple and easy to understand, but it isn't very user friendly. Adding a few comments to tell the user to load the sample and turn on the sound, for example, would make the patch easier for the user."
"The patch is a simple variation of the assignment, and looks very clean. It is structure neatly from top to bottom and I know how the patch flows."
"The patch was simple and straight forward with an ease of design. They did add a ""victory"" and ""loser"" aside to a ""yes"" or ""no"" which added to the whole video game music choice. I did do a similar design and structure."
"Surprised to see something so simple, was expecting something a little more elaborate. In general it was aesthetically clean and pleasing."
"Very easy to use and the instructions in the information box made it clear as to what to expect. The sounds worked well, somewhat goofy but entertaining. Generally effective even though slightly over simplistic."
"Seems as if they recreated the very minimum technicality needed to fulfill the requirements of this projects, fortunately the sounds were entertaining. After looking at the sub patch I realize that there was a bit more thought put into than I realized. Appreciated being able to go in and look at the inner workings of the project. May have been fun to have some other sounds included. Always learning, realize I am going to have to up the ante next time!"
This patch looks different from the other ones I've looked at so far. It was definitely interesting. I would assume this person has prior knowledge of Max as this patch appears to be a bit more advanced. It was set up as a project with multiple folders instead of a single patch.
"I think that the sound quality is a little bit poor, so I can hear a lot of noise. The style of the music isn't in my area of interest, but I think it's pretty cool."
simple yet obviously complex
0
they did something nobody else did. a step up from the orig. assignment.
"This look is completely different from the rest of the patchers i have seen today and it is very unique and makes me wonder what it will do, it comes with instructions on how to use it and it has a short simple design."
It seems like an advanced form of patch because i did not quite understand how to get it to work. It says that the sound file is amen and in order to play it you have to from a new word from the word amen. It is a bit confusing.
I eventually got it to work after reading the instructions carefully but overall the patch itself looks short at a glance and there is a sub patch that actually does all of the work in it and i think that is pretty fancy.
Pretty simple patch. Not complicated.
"I cant get the sound to load at all. I dont know if the problem is on my end, but the last patch worked for me."
Couldnt get it to work.
"The patch looks well organized in terms of visually clean, the connectivity of the patch is very sharp and visually appealing. The terms associated with the yes, patch are sounds that would be an obvious strong indication of the, positive, ""yes"" or negative ""no""keys. Prior to interacting with the program I couldn't actually see the speaker connected to the rest of the model or the meter."
"Technically the patching looks fine. It looks like the assignment was followed exactly, the only thing I did not see was the meter. I did not see anything out of the norm in terms of a new feature or function that was not assigned. I really do like the visual aesthetics were very appealing. I did not learn anything new from the way the programming was completed. I think would could have possible been improved was just the recording sound of the wave files, they were just really low."
I love the sound. The audio is an actual person talking not just tones.
The overall feeling I got when looking at the patcher was that it was cleanly laid out. My personal preference would be to line up the edges of the bottom boxes with the edges the message patches above. A minor point!!!
I figured out how to open finally!!! Catchy recordings
lThis is the basic minimum nothing was done beyond the tutorial
0
"The coding assignment was formatted and completed the same way as it was done in class, but there was an additional sound meter added.
 
 
 
 They could have left comments such as what key number 97 is."
"I think that the patch that you made is clean, and well organized."
"I love the music that you picked. The quality of the sound is pretty good, and the style is really unique, and not clichÃ©. I'm really enjoy playing this interactive."
"I think you did a good jobs, and also picked a really impressive music, however I think that you might be able to try something more advance or more creative."
"Looks like the class example, clean and easy to read. only thing that differs a bit is the volume control."
"Feel very simple to use, the only thing was the volume control has a setting so at first even when I turned the speaker on I couldn't hear it. After a little time I was able to figure it out."
"The sounds varied a bit compared to the class example, it was a little more pleasing then hearing just ""yes"" and ""no"" over and over again."
It felt rather complicated and guideless.
"It felt confusing due to the lack of directions on the sound bar. With that, it lead to the patch being rather complex."
"It was approached in a different way than what the lecture taught, which is always welcome. What the creator could do is to explain the features of the patch so new users don't get lost on it."
"The presentation is very plain, and looks like they didn't customize it. It is kind of symmetrical, but it looks like they finished it and didn't experiment."
It is minimalistic and neat. It feels easy to follow if you know introductory knowledge of Max/MSP.
"I'd say it feels like the ""average"" good key bad key game where you quickly sort through the key choices until you find the right one, guessing roughly where it might be based on the key print feedback. It feels a bit more beautiful than goofy based on the audio feedback. It still leads me to feel mildly amused and more engaged with playing with the audio as it's a bit more appealing."
"This is another bare bones basically and neatly structured patch. If they wanted to do more they could have used background colors, made the key a bit more difficult to find with key combinations, and other slightly more complicated additions to the game."
only thing i would change would be to get it to work by pressing keyboard buttons
"It looks like there is no actual selection operator for the good key or bad key. There are comments however but they didn't seem to relate to the content of the patch. My question is: were they trying to use the MATCH object, but didn't use it successfully?"
"Not adequate, extra simple patch and concept but it still did not work."
"I was not able to make any sounds happen, and I did not see a select function used so the program seems to be struggling to complete the required code. It is easy to see where I am typing, however."
"It was fairly straight forward so I did not learn anything new in the coding. I think to do this better the author could have added the select message to operate the program to make sound. I think the clarity was well accomplished, and in the future they can focus on being more technically intense."
Code not complicated.
Couldn't get it to work properly.
"It looks very basic, much like mine."
I could not get the keys to trigger sounds.
"They did the basic requirement, but I was unable to trigger the actual sounds."
"Feels like the class example, simple to read, and this one has text boxes with directions which make it a bit easier to read."
"Coding system similar to that of class example, only difference was the sounds, maybe a few different sounds added in to the mix would have helped."
The patch looks nice but with a few extraneous pieces. Unfortunately there is a note telling me exactly which key is the right one so I didn't have to look for it. It kind of defeats the purpose of this patch.
"The sounds were unimpressive. They are just two random noises. They don't feel ""right"" or ""wrong"". If I didn't know what the patch was supposed to do, I wouldn't even know if I had hit the correct key because the sounds are just random, no good or bad feeling to them."
"Technically, the patch was perfect. Though there was nothing original about it except the sounds, it did what the assignment asked."
The feel of this particular patch is very clean cut and to the point. The symmetrical alignment of the objects helps create a simple yet effective vibe.
"The coding assignment was very similar to the screencast. The one exception being that they placed buttons before the 'open' messages. For someone who was unfamiliar with Max or any kind of code, I felt it enhanced the patch from a visual aesthetic and also let the user clearly see what the patch was doing. I think that this was where I was forced to wrap my mind around something. Some could argue that the buttons are unnecessary and it might have a pure simplicity without them."
"It looks and feels a bit complicated, as if there is too much going on the screen at once."
Both 'yes' and 'no' give a response that I would expect. The 'yes' is positive and the 'no' is negative.
"The student added in an extra tool for showing the audio level, yet besides that, there is nothing surprising or exciting. It seems that they tried to add more to it, even with the little we have learned in class. It's hard to say what could have been done better."
The sounds are movie quotes and take longer amount of time to run than the other sound bits. The meter and levelmeter both light up and provide a visual feedback as well as the sound.
"I really like how things are laid out in this patch, it is pleasant to look at. They did show the winning key however, which doesn't make the game much 'fun'. There are some added functions like the meters which give the patch more personality."
"I think that the patch that you made is really clean, and well organized. I also saw that you have a decibel meter to measure the sound, which is really cool to me."
"I think that the sound that you picked is really funny, so I'm really enjoy using it."
It looks like the patch that was assigned to us!
"It looks pretty basic, with some added features like the meter and color feedback from the bangs of incorrect and correct key choices."
"It's amusing that they used the traditional mac error sound and the other sound for the correct key press was generally pleasing. It feels pretty easy to use, mildly aesthetically and audibly pleasing and neatly organized. It gives a pretty good experience, but this game gets old pretty quickly after you've played it a handful of times."
"They did more than the minimum for this assignment so kudos for going through the little extra effort to beautify your patch. I learned I could easily have added color to my patch for a slightly more pleasing experience. Also, people will definitely hate my ""wrong"" sound and that's sadistically pleasing."
"Overall, the design was fairly simple with very few alterations to what the instructor created in class."
Nothing very exciting or surprising was noticed in this project since all elements of the assignment were similar to the instructor's design.
The look and feel was simple.
"At first I thought my computer wasn't working because of the generic sound that Mac's usually make when a key doesn't work, but it was actually the ""no"" key."
"The patch was simple, one ""yes"" key."
Looks like it could be tighter/organized slightly more.
At the moment I cannot hear the sound files of any of the programs because I am not on a Mac I think. Patch appears to be working correctly based on the buttons lighting up.
The approach was pretty straightforward ad followed the in class instructions.
"At a glance the patch looks good, there is plenty of room and space for it to be seen without confusion and it comes with some handy tips and comments on how to get it to work if you do not find the key it has the answer so it does not frustrate you. The overall look is simple yet amazing."
One of the sounds was funny it made me chuckle but the no sound was a simple no which i would of preferred it to make another sound other than the obvious no or incorrect try again.
The overall feel of the patch is very technical and clean. The patch looks similar to the one done in class and has nice layout.
The sounds are goofy and funny. They make you want to do the patch over and over again because the sounds are entertaining to listen to. It leads a very pleasing and funny experience for the user.
They approached the coding assignment very typically. The patch looks similar to the tutorial done in class. They added the meter for extra flare. I did learn that I should have used more comments in my own patch since it can be very confusing without them.
Looks very basic.
It was kinda funny. The militaristic samples rose a chuckle out of me.
They did the basic requirement.
conceptually it was compartmentalized.
there are several ways to code. this student opted to keep things seperate instead of coding together.
goofy. the sounds used are goofy.
"abrupt. Others took time to make the code elegant, long, or truncated, but you could see the connections. Inputs & outputs. None are seen here."
"The patch was clean and simple, once again I noticed the extra toggles. There was no media lines used so it felt kind of plain."
"Small boxes in general, somewhat squishy and close but it does not take away from the performance of the patch. Same like the one in class."
"Seriously kind of aggrivated. I understand why the coding was so squished now, because the key to activate it was control and the v key. And no, I did not figure it out on my own, I looked it up because I was so annoyed I kept hearing high ho silver awaaaay. When I finally heard the correct sound I was a bit confused, but I guess it makes sense it was talking about teeth and having silver plates on them or else it could cause gingivitis? I don't know, didn't understand that joke.."
"The patch works great, and responds to the keys accurately."
"The sounds are awesome and unique, this is a very well done patch."
"This patch is very simple, and it's easy to understand the signal flow."
"Firstly, the sounds are fantastic. The creator expertly utilizes the concept of ""cuteness"". Even though the patch is very simple, the fact that it makes ""human"" sounds gives it an air of humanity."
"Visually this patch is extremely sharp looking. The cable line that he used to connect the components look like a piece of art work in itself, with a very mechanical feel. The patch looks very straightforward and user friendly, and followed the guidelines of the assignment exactly."
"I thought the user experience was overall very strong with this patch, not only from visual aesthetics, but from the functionality as well. The sounds were entertaining, especially the good key. The sounds were definitely goofy, which make the user interface more fun."
"This patch was techinically very visually creative and functionally as well. I did learn to try to stretch myself creatively in terms of trying to program my patch to have an artistic quality as well, and not just merely connect components for functionality purposes, included stretching creativity in sounds waves as well. I do not really have any recommendations for improvements, I think they did a great job."
"Looks similar to class example but minus the ""numbers"" box to see exactly what number this was, this made it a bit tougher."
"Coding was very similar to class example, easy to follow, and it had quite an entertaining outcome."
"The patch followed the guidelines perfectly. This patch did not contain each step by step explanation for each button which I have been used to seeing. However, it works perfectly, it is still easy to navigate and I don't think anything could have been done differently."
Simple and not as developed as it could have been. On a positive note it was not intimidating.
The patch looks very simple. Easy to understand what is intended.
Doesn't look like its going to work.
Couldn't get the code to work. I'm not sure if this is a problem on my end.
Couldn't get it to work.
"Looks good, everything all lined up. I like it."
Clean looking patch
I felt like I was in Vegas for a minute.
"nothing out of the ordinary, just the basic patch from the video."
This is perhaps the most basic incarnation of this particular assignment. The sounds are predictable and obvious in their connotation.
"Nothing about the patch is surprising from a technical perspective, but it works well."
"It was a quick experience, but pleasant. The sounds were not obnoxious and nicely leveled. The sounds were traditional positive and negative sounds for guesses, so it wasn't an out of the ordinary experience."
"Technically, it was a simple setup, and nothing too out of the box. Everything worked as it should, and when it should. Nothing exciting, and nothing boring or unusual. As for what could be done better, I got nothing since everything worked and everything was laid out as it should."
"I enjoy the use of different color buttons for notifying when the Good/Bad key is struck. Very simple, easy to navigate."
It feels very simple to use. It's stated exactly what you have to spell out in order to hear both sounds and activate the good/bad key. I enjoy the sounds.
They approached it as we did in class except they added buttons with different colors for visually informing when a good/bad key is struck. I learned that the colors of the buttons can be changed to give a visual representation of when keys are struck.
"I like the concise look and minimal use of space. The author still gives the message, but without a lot of looking around. It feels like the author copied the template, made it more concise, and added their own versions of yes and no."
"So far this patch is the smallest I've seen. Everything is very condensed which almost makes it look clustered but also gives the patch a sense of unity. It's very clear everything works together and makes the patch seem like a whole thing rather than a bunch of parts working together. This aesthetic is very interesting, I haven't seen it before."
I think the way they organized the patch was surprising; a lot of people had their patch spread out far apart and made sure the user could separate the different parts easily. This patch sort of bunches everything together giving it a new feel. I don't think there's anything they need to do to improve their assignment.
"The patch itself is pretty good, the sounds are funny and entertaining. Its a decent patcher but I actually did have to hunt down the specific good key which took a little time but then again that is the point of this assignment so all in all its a delightful patcher. The space sounds blew me away."
"Very simple, I like it."
I wouldn't use sounds that have such similarities unless you are trying to confuse your audience.
It looks nice and simple. Very small and compact.
at first glance the patch looked complicated. however the patch notes were helpful.
This patch was very entertaining. it almost had a soundboard feel and I just wanted to make custom mixes of train sounds.
It looks fairly organized and well constructed. It feels very straightforward and efficient.
"I think it works very well. The sounds are cool and offer a kind of variety, so that was nice. The experience was always unique due to the variations in the sounds which made it that much more entertaining."
"I think the patch looks really cool. I learned a few new things like the counter. As I went through it, I thought of ways to make it simpler, but Overall, I think it looks really good. Great Job!"
Before I ran the patch the overall look and feel was very confusing to me at first. I was unsure how it worked together. I have limited experience with Max and this may be my reason for my confusion but I do think it could be a little more cleaned up.
"The patch was pretty entertaining to work with and would be something fun to use for a kid. Although, when I was working with It I was confused with what keys I was pressing to make the different sounds. The sounds weren't necessarily ""good"" or ""bad"" therefore I think the keys I was pressing should have been more straight forward but they felt random."
"I think you did a very good job technically working on this. Although the code was confusing to me, after I played around with the sounds for a while it was easier to see how it works. You also did a good job explaining the changes that you made, making it easier to understand. After looking at your code and the changes made on it from what we did in class, I learned a few new ways to connect the keys and make it so there is multiple ""good keys"" and ""bad Keys""."
"Kind of confusing. It seems as though Tom tried to create two different Good Key Bad Key patches and put them together to form one. It seems that he experimented and tried to create a more advanced, more complex version of what we made in class."
They approached it exactly as we did in the classroom. I didn't really learn anything from what they did because it's very similar to mine. I would at least organize the different objects.
Looks very simple and similar to the patch shown in class. does not have any notes.
the experience is very simple but it works.
again. very simple.
Simple to look at. Nothing different or unusual about the patch. Basically what we learned in class. There were no comments on the patch to let me know what the good key was.
Technically simple. I would have liked an overlap of sound that two speakers would have given the patch. It would have made it more fun to use.
"The patch looks somewhat like a copy of the patcher example, but with some stuff removed and moved around. It is clean, but does not seem to have a particular orginization attached to it."
"It is the most difficult experience I ran in to because I could not find key 110 and the author did not tell me which one it was. Granted, if the purpose of the code was to find the key, then the author completed this marvelously. I was also still able to listen to the sounds, and this helped further the appeal."
"They also seemed to follow the pattern laid out in class, without adding anything additional. This completed the assignment but did not go overboard in any way."
The look of the patch is virtually the exact same as our example from class last week.
"The patch feels identical to the example, as for usage. The sounds for the ""bad"" keys sound like a hi-hat or other cymbal on a drum kit, and the ""good"" key plays a full groove for almost 10 seconds. Overall, it's simple, and does what we wanted it to."
"Like I said before, it is virtually identical to the example from class. I would suggest cleaning up the patch cords and organization of objects a little more."
"The aesthetic look of the patch is appealing and it has all the components with some of the other patches have been missing. The design of the patch is predominantly on a vertical plane, but here is uniformity and it looks balanced with how the components were placed. It looks user friendly and well defined."
"The visual appearance is definitely uniform and appealing conceptually by the simplicity of the design. It definitely allow for a user interface that is not intimidating. I really like the sounds in this patch, they are entertaining. The bad key, had the wah, wah, wah zany sound effect, which is definitely a fitting sound for this key. They good key was great, it reminded me of being in an amusement park riding on a roller coaster."
"I think the coding was approached very well within the constraints of the assignments, meaning there was no other new or different technical components. However, it looks like they really did master the patch that they did complete. The only improvement I could make is to be more aware of the artist element of design within the patch. For example, the cables connecting the components could be connecting in a way to create more of artist representation of the piece."
Looks very basic.
