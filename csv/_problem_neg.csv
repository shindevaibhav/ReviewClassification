"Using the ideas laid out with creating music using RGB values, I think we could make something that also looks at everyday objects and people to create music in an experimental manner."
"A program that uses the keyboard controller they proposed in the first idea, but instead of just playing & recording music, the keys would also play colors that the creator would match up to certain notes or sounds according to their perception of emotion."
"In all of the projects, he or she discusses the use of lasers. Though the projects are very similar in their use of lasers, they are also fairly different ideas. The student made a good effort to expand upon their ideas and give details. They want one project using lasers as a form of data transfer, laser interactive project and another basic max/patch laser project."
Using a laser to initiate sounds while playing a game. Passing data via laser doesnt seem plausible to me.
"There are definitely three separate ideas proposed, but all based around similar technology: lasers. All seem like pretty solid ideas; one being to make a simple environment where laser are pointed at targets to create musical tones, another using laser signals to beam data between devices, and the last using lasers for a target practice type game."
"The first and third ideas seem most plausible. Combining the two, we could make certain noises when different targets are hit. Expanding on just the third idea, we could make a few different environments for the target simulator. Maybe something as simple as the silhouette targets police use in a shooting range, or as complex as a city street/alley/etc."
"I feel the student elaborated enough to get o good idea of what they are aiming for.
 
 The first idea is to create some kind of musical instrument incorporating lasers.
 
 The second idea is to use lasers to send information to different devices they also stated that some of the technology may need to be further developed.
 
 The last idea is some sort of shooting game with lasers and a projector."
The first one the student wants to make is a music system which controlled by some unique instruments. The second one is to build anthropopathic robot soldiers. The third one is to build a virtual reality glove.
"Overall, I believe this person put a decent amount of thought into the ideas. Each idea is written vividly and thoroughly. 
 
 The first idea is basically to create a device that generates midi sounds with an arduino and some buttons/knobs. 
 
 The second idea is basically creating remote control soldiers for the use of the army, essentially making military deaths a thing of the past.
 
 The third idea is to create a glove that works with the oculus rift to track hand movements to be translated into the virtual world within the oculus rift."
"If I were to collaborate with this student, I would try and find a good blend between using the oculus rift and glove ideas, with the robot army idea. They both are necessary for eachother, so I think that makes complete sense."
"Honestly, anything I can think of has already been done. My initial thought was to combine 1 & 3, to make a glove that works like a midi controller. However, that was basically done recently by Imogen Heap. Another idea would be to combine the soldier drone suit and the game controller. Just having a full-body controller for VR systems, but that would take more than a semester."
"This student made a sincere effort in proposing the ideas, as each one feels thought out to the extent that they can be in such a short amount of time. The first idea was to make a midi controller, which seems to require hardware that is simple to make and some programming that this student is not confident in doing. The second idea was to make unmanned robots that function similarly to human beings, allowing soldiers to control one as if it was their own body without the risk of death. The third idea was a glove for virtual reality that can mimic the actions of the player, allowing the player to interact with the virtual world similarly to the real world, potentially with haptic feedback."
"The answers displayed here show that a lot of thought was put into these questions. Everything was answered clearly and concisely, with lots of detail and creativity."
"I'd love to work with the arduino live music control. One thing we could add would be programable visuals with the live music, in order to enhance the live experience. This could be with projection mapping, color recognition, or even animations."
I like the idea of having an app that allows you to interact with a concert you are attending. I also like the idea of having sort of one central app that allows you to research and donate to causes around the world. I think that would be the best bet.
"Seeing as how this student is very arts based with design, video, and music, I feel we could work well together as I do myself have many artistic qualities (I am also a musician) but I also have some programming experience to work on the more technical level. I think it would be possible to work on some iteration, if not the complete idea, of the third proposed project. We could probably achieve a basic prototype form through the use of Max MSP I would assume. We could blend their experience of live sound and my capacity to finagle Max."
"Overall I felt that the student made a good effort to explain their ideas. 
 
 
 
 1. An unspecified rough app or computer program. 
 
 
 
 2. A series of sensors in bikes and/ or cars that alert drivers/ cyclists to potential collisions. 
 
 
 
 3. An app that the city/ police can use to see where cyclist have had accidents or poor experiences so that changes can be made to prevent future accidents."
"Rolling with this idea, the student and I could make an app that would allow people to rate and share experiences of certain routes or part of a city for use by cyclists. Users would record their experiences, along with a positive or negative rating, and link them to a certain area on a map of the city. Overall ratings for different areas would show up over time, giving both locals and visitors a map of safe biking routes and notable places to avoid."
"This student is looking to create a prototype of an interface that is beneficial to those who like to ride their bicycles on the road and care about their safety. I think they did clearly propose their motivations and thoughts, being concerned with improving public cycling collisions and allowing some sort of warning system."
"I am a cyclist myself and have designed my own apps on photoshop, so this actually is interesting to me. Maybe in the app include some of the traffic going on in areas and color coding the safety with the roads."
I believe that some solid effort was put into this by the student. The ideas were well thought out and put lots of variables into consideration with cycling. Cycling is a largely used mode of transportation so these ideas will most likely be successful.
If I was your partner I think Id like to focus on researching the ways large cities are doing this. Id like to propose a way to physically make cycling safer threw lights that interact with cars and the roadways. If we could come up with a way to make communication easier for a cyclist while they ride I think that would achieve some part of your goal. If we could update a rider of upcoming dangers as they ride that would be helpful.
"This student definitely went in depth and was really detailed about what they would do in these situations. I honestly believe they could get a lot done in a week from the first question, do something really awesome and a lot of good from the second question, and continue their project on and make it better in the third answer."
"I could definitely collaborate in making a video or board game with them, creating sketches or doing animation, and I think that would be a lot of fun, especially if it is combined with the other two ideas, into an interactive game, maybe for physical therapy or something. I wouldn't be able to do much with the VR part, but I could definitely help with design."
"The first, week-long project would simply be an outline for a longer-term project.
 
 The second idea is to develop some form of cerebral interface for virtual reality games.
 
 The third idea is to create an AI that learns from it's mistakes."
I could help to develop the visual representations for this world the AI will explore or meld with. But that's about all I'd have to offer to this project.
"It might be interesting to do sort of an augmented reality space - a physical landscape used in a ""game"" in which a user completes tasks/challenges with the aid of things like visual displays (a la Google Glass) and actuator gloves."
"I can imagine his/her project would be foundation stone for future project about the NCVR and AI. If he/she meet and collaborate with designers such as a visual, sound, and media installation person, this project would be great interactive gaming system. This project is quite impressive for me."
"By the look of it, I think we could make a really good VR game together. The ideas and goals are all there, we would just need to work for a long time to reach those goals. Game are a huge part of my life so I could think of lots of ideas on how this project could take off."
Yes they made a effort with their three ideas being. 1. To build a moto-Bike of some sort similar to a moped. 2. To create a water powered system to create energy. 3. To make an interactive environment with lasers and such.
I thing a projection based art project would be cool we could make some sort of projection mapping setup that allowed the laser graffiti to be made on a number of different objects.
This student mentioned wanting to do some kind of game and I wanted to do games and incorporate fitness and gaming. So with an arcade game we could find a way to make something that got the body moving. He also wanted to do something with generating power but with water. Well we could make a game that generated power based on body movement. That would be really fun.
1. Put a motor on the bike. 2. Find some thing can save water or other resources. 3. Using laser technology into projection mapping.
"I am very interesting in the third idea. I am also like projecting mapping and interactive project. Base on your idea, I would like to do some ""gun"" game. The gun could have the laser in it, so when you ""shoot"" the wall, the wall will has a ""real"" black hole. On the projection mapping wall, we can create some visual effects that has strong connection with the gun."
"I love the idea of cars running on water. The change to the environment it would make would be spectacular. Also, the laser gun and light graffiti both sound really fun and artistic."
"We could probably make (with a bit of programming knowledge) an awesome game where, as it has been said, draw lines with lasers on a giant projected light wall. The fundamentals seem pretty basic for something that could turn out to be really cool."
"Okay:
 
 
 
 I picture this proposition of creating some sort of ""photon graffiti"" that would SOMEHOW work by vandalizing anything you want in an extremely removable way. Maybe something that could last for a few hours only or who knows.
 
 
 
 Maybe I am thinking way too outside the box, let's try again:
 
 
 
 A projector that is kept on for scribbling anything on your wall for reminders and what not, using ""light pens"", and not worry about having a corkboard or whiteboard for everything you wanna plan. Go caveman on it and scribble freely in the room without making an actual mess.
 
 
 
 These sci-fi movies sometimes have these fancy holograms to make a visual explanation of their plans and we could develop something similar, except much more versatile and less impossible like holograms that pop out of thin air."
"I would take idea number 2 because at least we both would be interested in some kind of reform in education funding. We could work on an artpiece that would show how our government allocates money. Since we would be tackling politics, having the funds of billions of dollars would allow us to say whatever is necessary, regardless of what corporations/people are offended."
"My ideas involved animation, and this students ideas involved collaboration/team-building and taking on a major issue (College costs).
 
 
 
 So a joint project might take the form of an exploration of some major problem or concern, and an animation that enhances some aspect of our efforts or our reporting. It might be used to explain the problem, to explain a proposed solution, to explore the issue further, or report on the successes or failures of our efforts. In many things, including animation, a team usually make it easier."
I feel personally that I could help with the first idea of planning things and putting them into motion. One thing I could do would be possibly build some rough prototypical components of some ideas they have to gauge how it might function in a real life application.
"For your semester project goal, I think you might be onto something. Many freshmen come into college shocked at how different it is in comparison to high school, and thus, take a while to get settled down into their new world. Maybe you could construct a game that helps freshmen college student ""learn the ropes"" if it were to how to survive your college experience. Maybe tailor made to ASU instead of a general college survival guide, you could make games that illustrate how to use Blackboard or Ctitviz, maybe include a 3D map of the school in a racing game that subconsciously teaches you how to get around the school campus."
"In the past I have worked on classical compositions, musicals, and even post production for short films. In this case, I would love to use my skills in sound design, musical composition, and as a musician to integrate sound and audio into the experience of games. I would love to find a way to use sound in a way that it has never been used for in games to create a dynamic interactive experience in games. On a much more simple note, I would also like to create the theme music for this person's games."
I would like to work on this project because my idea is about fitness as well. If we can incorporate on kind of campaign about well-fitness and create an event or program that utilize this game I believe this project will be incredible project to work on. If people see there are incentives on exercising and also being fit because the ultimate goal is about fitness and seeing that it is fun to work out they would participate on the event/game.
"Idea 1: a simple game that measures reaction time to different situations, and shows these times against the times of others.
 
 Idea 2: A collection of games that promote exercise and fitness, some of which incorporate gym equipment, all of which are part of a larger businesslike organization.
 
 Idea 3: Expanding an already established gaming company that focuses on college course material.
 
 
 
 This student has clearly-proposed three ideas and has touched on the details and motivations for them."
"My ideas involve animation, and this student's ideas involve gaming (specifically concerning fitness and foundation building for classes).
 
 
 
 So a joint project would probably take the form of a video game. I have done 3D art for video games, and any game that incorporated character animation (as so many do) would align with my main interest in animation."
"I like the idea for the graphic design that would get the world excited about helping make earth a better place to be. I have a similar idea that I think could go along this, adding social media capabilities, and getting as many people involved as possible."
"There is a coherent project idea in each answer. 
 
 
 
 1. A set of hand painted images than could be formatted into booklets for special occasions. 
 
 
 
 2. An interactive building facade on a skyscraper that changed base don the people in it or by it that highlighted them in some way. 
 
 
 
 3. A business that creates games that are both educational and entertaining."
"Working on a small game or proof of concept that taught geologic principles through exploration of underground tunnels and caves would be a potential idea. The idea for this is to have students discover different types of rock and geological processes while actually down in the depths of the earth, showing why this information si interesting firsthand."
The three ideas can be combined into one. I am thinking of displaying the wedding book's pictures at the side of the Skyscraper where people passing by can interact with the pictures with their hand movements as though they are playing video games.
"Well working within the education game, you could possible extend the controller of the program into physical space. Using arduino to create physical controllers would be simple and could create a new realm for the game to be played in."
"As I said before, it would be awesome to have a game that allowed the game community and its aspiring developers be the creation factor of the maps, levels, and content. I would love to collaborate and work as the creative/business side of the video game design process. It would be great to work as a team to deliver content to existing games or even new games that promote community driven creation within games. This would give power to the game community, almost like an ultimate sandbox."
"Idea one is to design a game, non-functional, but with the architecture in place. Idea two is to essentially make their own video game development company and eventually build the best game possible. Lastly, idea 3 is to make a small exploration driven game, examples are stated but I have no experience with any of them to know what they may be."
"You know what you want to do so the stretching your thinking can be done in the context of your video game. since we are talking about making the world a better place does the game teach the user, inform them, anything other then just entertaining them?"
i could help with what goes on in the game. The story line or goal in the game.
1. A first person shooter game. 2. He would like to do many games to gain experiences. Then he will use his experience to do a big game which has important topics to the society. 3.A small exploration driving game.
I would choose to help work on their mobile device application. Although I would try to specialize the app in one particular area like sound and the measurement of decibels. From there I could branch out into using gps tracking data in order to link connections between the decibel readings and the location of the device. This could be used to help find good study locations and develop better studying habits.
I think that the student displayed a nicely planned out set of steps that would allow the project to flourished.
"If I was to work with this student, then I would extend the app to maybe act more like a artificial intelligence machine to interact with its users."
"If the student is serious about creating an app, then maybe we could create a storytelling app with a significant visual element, like a web comic but with some interactivity. Maybe a choose your own adventure with dynamic visuals and some animation."
"I like the idea of using patrol devices, but this can be risky since I'm sure they will not be cheap and you have to worry about people messing with or breaking or stealing them. I also like the idea of creating an app as sort of a personal side kick."
I think these ideas are pretty well thought out and practical. The doorknob thing sounds kinda fun. Each of these ideas take the concepts and skills we're developing in DC and applying them in imaginative ways.
I'd love to draw storyboards for this person's Great Wall idea. The idea of displaying cultural history in a visually dynamic way is intriguing to me.
I think that the student made some really good suggestions about creating a arduino program that has some sort of interactive aspect.
"If I was to work with this student, then I would suggest that we extend on the idea of making a arduino program that can sense the temperature and gives some sort of results."
"I would have this student's knowledge of Arduino assist me in getting together a system that plays a colored light when a person presses a button, but then also takes a picture of that person at that same time; thus creating a ""selfie"" filter that is created instantly like a photobooth. Another use for it is we could do long exposure photos, and the user could press certain lights to light the picture before drawing with their LED."
"I really liked the idea of a video game that submerged the user into a virtual world. I think perhaps with a pair of virtual reality glasses, some sort of smart gloves and shoes, and perhaps some sort of outfit that had different sensors sewn into the material, this might be possible. This project would however, likely be very involved, and take a great deal of time and resources to accomplish."
I like your idea of building a simple arduino program with a simple sensor system to interact with the user.
"If I was to work with this student, then I would recommend that we create a system that tracks hand movements but instead of a RC car or plane, we would use a simple robot."
"I think it would be possible to use their hand movement idea and incorporate it into some kind of game, perhaps made in Unity. A possible idea would be to use the Kinect and have the camera track hand movements, and certain hand movements would control the character/plane/car in a simple game."
I think they tried to streak thinking somewhat. Their 3 ideas are - 1. An interactive system with arduino. 2. Make the matrix. 3. A digital physical system that tracks movement to control an RC device.
I think creating a system to track movement and turn that into to controls of an RC device or like a game or somthing would be fun. This has alread been done using the kinect or WII so a new cool way to do it would need to be devised.
"The project of most interest to me would be working to create a therapy program for children with special needs. I know little about this field, but I believe the project would require a great deal of research, and the creation of applicable audio and visuals."
"Given the intent of the assignment the student satisfied all the needs and was very thorough throughout the entire assignment. They had very clear purpose in the entire assignment and were very concise.
 
 In the first idea the student stated the steps that they would go through in order to complete a project in a week. In the second idea the student was very clear on what they would do with the money in the answer and what they would use the money for, and to create a machine for special needs children. The last idea was the student wanting to create a project that records brainwaves."
I like the Dubai Vacation for brainstorming. I feel that you need to have diversity and variety of locations to brainstorm ideas. If theres ever a trip like that count me in! As far as the mobile mouse case idea goes I think you should finish the product. I saw the pitch and the progress in the previous semester and it is an interesting product.
The only idea that you had was finishing up the mobile mouse case and it seems like your are really focused on getting this prototype finish I would like to collaborate on this product to get this finish if we had to work together.
1. The student said that he/she can finish lots of things in a week. But it depended on the resources. 2. Go to Dubai for brainstorming.3. Mobile mouse case! Sounds cool and I hope you can tell more details about it.
I would team up with this person and try to figure out a way to record and add video clips into a short loop composition that could be layered similar to how audio can be recorded and looped. I could just have certain opacities when I record 3-4 different clips and it would create something different and new every time to project.
"If we were to work in a group, I would try to blend the ideas of a digital physical system, the app, and the internet infrastructure to somehow create some sort of interconnected environment that is connected to all and is controlled by the phone app. This could be used to interact with others within the environment to do whatever the user wants. For example, if someone walks into the environment, I could trigger a device to turn on from my app on the phone."
"Maybe you could mix your first and third idea for a mobile application that interacts with your physical installation. People could download the app and answer a few questions (like what did you eat for breakfast?) and when they arrived at the installation you could scan for their device, pull their questionnaire, and projection map objects that correspond to them (like waffles if that's what they had for breakfast). The beauty of it would be that other participants in the installation would not know that you were to the one would had waffles, so it would provide a level of voyeurism to each of the participants allowing them to look into someones life without not who they were looking at."
"The student here is perhaps overly succinct, but seems confident that they can create something worthwhile over the course of the semester. I really like the idea of trying to increase and improve internet connectivity in this country. Other industrialized countries have bandwidth and speed that put us to shame. Replacing all of the old copper lines with fiber would be awesome!"
"If the student goes with creating a game I'd love to do character and concept sketches, storyboards and other visual aspects."
"Idea 1 is to make a graphic that they would paint on their motorcycle, from design to finish. Idea 2 is a movement to get people more active in the US. Idea 3 is app that connects motorcycle enthusiast to each other."
The app is a great idea because as far I know there are none out there for motorcyclist enthusiasts. For the project you could even combine the idea of graphics for motorcycles and use the app to share cool projects that people may be working on or want to collaborate on.
I really do believe that this student made a sincere effort with this assignment and thinking about what they really want to do in these situations. I think that they really dug deep in thinking what they would want to do based off of what they love to do with their hobbies.
"I think that we could really collaborating on something here. For one, I love print design and working in Illustrator to create fun graphics, so I think we would be able to collaborate on motorcycle designs to possibly sell! 
 
 
 
 I also believe we could make an awesome animation for a health PSA, since I would want to do an animation for my answers last week, and they want do get the word out for people to be healthier, we could collaborate and make a really fun animated PSA about it, and with the money given to us, that we would be able to use it for advertising and getting celebrity endorsements."
My DC concentration is insound so I would be very interested in finding a way to incorporate his sound project.
"I like your enthusiasm, and I would definitely work on a project with you if you brought this kind of attitude into a group project. I too would choose to work on a project that could extend beyond the classroom into helping the outside world with what I have learned within the DC program. Last year I worked on developing a garden that took care of itself with the help of an arduino. However this proved to be a really difficult project for only one person to work on, and was never completed to it's full potential. Therefore if you happen to stumble across an idea that your really feel passionate about, I would be on board to help make it happen."
I would like to start with the idea of the short film and trying to make the world a happier place. I feel that an inspirational short film can help the world or a group of people feel happier. What would we base it off of and what target audience would we push it towards?
"I believe that with the first idea is definitely something that both me and the student could work on. I love films and I love working on films, I think that could definitely be a fun project to work on with someone else, I also believe we could combine elements of the second idea in order to make an inspirational film about how people can be happy and train themselves to think in more positive ways."
"The student clearly proposes three separate ideas. For the first, the student's idea is for a short film. While they don't say what the topic will be, they do say that the short would not include explosions or CGI of any sort.
 
 
 
 For the second idea, the student would spend the money on something that could give clean water, or make self driving cars.
 
 
 
 The third idea was to create music."
"My ideas involve 3D animation, and this student's ideas involve filmmaking, humanitarian organization, and music making.
 
 
 
 So a joint project might could take many forms. Humanitarian concerns can be (and are commonly) addressed in both film and music, and animation can go with both. Maybe it is an animated short film (or at least partially animated), or maybe it is an animated music video to a song or series of songs."
"Idea 1: an interaction based installation that incorporates data from different devices, or robotic display.
 
 Idea 2: work to develop cheaper hardware to benefit future designers and problem-solvers.
 
 Idea 3: A screen made up of a grid of independent, hanging LEDs that move to emulate the reflection on the water in a glass in response to a participant disturbing it."
"My ideas involve animation, and this student's ideas involve a robotic screen that reacts to participants' interactions.
 
 
 
 So a joint project might take the form of an installation that incorporates animations expressed in physical 3D on a robotic screen and viewer interaction."
"First idea is to develop an interactive light show or system.
 
 The second idea is to find ways to make things that are expensive and time consuming to do now, cheaper and more efficient.
 
 The third idea is to okay with light, water, and perception."
Together we could create some kind of interaction between a physical and digital system.
"Yes, I think they though deeply about what they could and would do."
I have created musical compositions for musicals in the past and I would love to be a part of a team to create new content for musicals. It would also be a privilege to find a way to create a good quality theatre performances in other countries.
Well they appear to be interested in graphics and rich story line. We could certainly make a roleplaying game out of their novel.
"I think he/she seem like a visual artist, especially 3d animator or interactive media. I can imagine this interactive media system relate with human body. I think 3D animation project is so many potential energy in diverse field like he/she is interested in human psychology."
"I can imagine how his/her project would be great if these three ideas will be developed. To make a go of it, I think he/she has to collaborate with kind of artists such as media installation, sound, or performers. These project ideas are impressive for me and it would be very helpful to make human life better if you develop his/her own system in this semester."
"We could develop some sort of animation together, as I had done a lot of animation work myself."
The student gave an honest and sincere effort and I believe gave some great answers. The student clearly proposes three ideas in their post. The first idea that the student proposes is essentially making a virtual character (which I think is really cool). The second idea was also a digital animation idea on making a very detailed video game. The last idea was about creating a digitally constructed visual.
If me and this student were assigned to collaborate for the semester I think we could make some very cool digital visuals because this student seems to be very experienced in making digital visuals and I am very artistic and creative and I think I could help this student with some great ideas for visuals that he could actually make on the computer.
There are three ideas proposed with significant information for me to understand the ideas. The first idea is to create a website or game. The second idea is to create a virtual world with content that mirrors this world. I love the idea of replicating an reliving historical time periods. The third idea is to create a game with intelligent AI that can replicate a human player.
"The larger proposed idea is the creation of an entire virtual world and simulator that would allow for the user to transport themselves anywhere. The second idea is making a video game that centers around AI making it seem as if the computer's AI could be a human. The second idea is basically a smaller version of the first, larger idea."
"I think that this student and I could work very well together. My background is in computers and computer programming as well, I think we could take the smaller idea as is and make it into a full blown project."
"The first idea is to do some programming for a video game.
 
 The second idea is to create a very high end video game.
 
 The third idea is to create a less high end video game than in idea 2."
We could make a videogame.
"This student made a very sincere effort and gave some very interesting answers, the student clearly proposed three ideas. The first idea is about showcasing project mapping by using max msp. The second idea is an interactive gaming system for children in hospitals that involves a digital environment. The last idea was creating a new way of playing video games that eliminates ""screen watching""."
"It is very apparent that this person to the time and effort to sincerely answer all three idea questions. They go into detail on what they exactly want to accomplish as well as what tools they would like to use for their project. I could very easily get a picture in my head for each of their three concepts and thus believe they explained their points clearly and concisely.
 
 
 
 Their ideas: 
 
 
 
 One Week: They wish to using projection mapping for either an art gallery or to show off their own line of clothing. They would use Max msp to facilitate the projection mapping and would plan on using video.
 
 
 
 Unlimited Time and Money: The wish to create a digital environment projection mapped into a room that children in hospitals and explore and play with using their hands or feet instead of controllers.
 
 
 
 Realistic Semester: A cube that would not allow the transgression of video game screen looking to cheat when planing with friends. This cube will have each player's perspective projection mapped on a different face making nigh impossible to catch a glimpse of what your friend in doing."
"This person has a major interest in projection mapping and interactive environments, this could be relatively easy to work with the appropriate direction and resource management. Even if there is an inclusion of a clothing brand, the proposals are concise and clear."
"My way-far-out-you-are-insane addition: let's make a completely projected room from the outside-in, possibly using something like four white cloth sheets and project a 3D space from outside and possibly add some sort of motion tracking mechanism with objects or the people.
 
 
 
 My bound-to-earth proposal: yeah, let's do that."
"The student's first idea is to carve a unique wolf sculpture, idea two is vague but has an endgame of creating an emotionally evocative space for individuals, and lastly idea 3 is to create an installation."
I honestly don't know what I'd have to offer this student as far as her project goes. She seems to have her concepts and procedures and work steps pretty thoroughly planned out and there's not much of a visually element that would make my drawing skills necessary.
They made a sincere effort and proposed three ideas. The first idea was to carve a hyper realistic figure of a wolf. The second was to create some sort of environment that creates something eco-friendly. The third was to create a frame to a viewer could see the light in some creative way.
"If I was to work with this student, then I would suggest focusing on a geometry oriented project."
The first idea was linking multiple consoles together to be able to play multiple video games from one console. The second idea is to develop an alternate timeline device that would allow users to experience their lives if they made different decisions. The third idea is to develop a virtual mermaid tank in which the mermaid would react dynamically to the environment.
"The student made a very good effort on his/her thoughts. All three ideas were detailed and gave the reader a good ideas as to what the student would want accomplished, and possible tools that would be used in order to accomplish their goals.
 
 
 
 Reiteration of ideas:
 
 Idea 1 - Creating a model of a stand to hold all of his electronic devices and chargers by his bed to watch from.
 
 
 
 Idea 2 - Creating wearable technology that is attached to the clothing that gathers solar, body heat, and kinetic energy, as a source of energy that could be stored into a battery.
 
 
 
 Idea 3 - Creating a virtual reality game for the oculus rift, likely a first person shooter, that also uses a suit, fans, and other devices to simulate a more realistic experience."
I think part of his third idea would likely be a good choice for a semester/year long project. A group of people would definitely be able to create a virtual world using Unity to create a simple first person shooter. This project could possibly be taken even further depending on the time and try to incorporate the coding needed to make this game usable with the Oculus Rift.
I think it would be feasible to build something like an interactive sculpture using sensors and computers to do the calculations and alter the sculpture.
I am not at all that religious but I would do my best to help set up these clubs and organizations. If they need an app or something I could help out and mix my idea into it but other than that I just don't see us collaborating.
"I think that maybe we could tie in the songs with individuals and their need for equality. I guess what I am saying is that we could make an installation that scans someones face, then according to their structure or facial expression, it would create a song for that person."
"I would like to go with the immersive environment animation because it coordinates well with my idea of make an immersive environment for sick children in a Child's Hospital. I feel if we made an animation sequence that can give the children a sense of POV of the character on their journey, that could greatly be helpful for them. Since most of the children do not have access to such adventures, we could make an immersive environment that can give them a sense of adventure. Also incorporate the clothing onto the child so say the child is a knight on a quest, the immersive environment would be projected onto the surrounded and a knight's outfit or armor can be projected onto the clothing of the child to really give them the POV of the character."
"These projects seem to be well thought out considering the constraints.
 
 The first is for a simple projection mapping on an object.
 
 The second is for a wearable system that communicates with projector some how to trigger different displays.
 
 The last is for a animation that gives the viewer two different perspectives, I think this would be interesting but might be complicated."
"The student I believe did give a sincere and to the point answer with their ideas, the student also clearly proposed three things. The first idea that the student spoke of was mapping animations on to objects and using the object's shape as a way of increasing the visual effects of the animations. The second idea was mapping and tracking clothing on individuals and using it for artistic purposes. The last idea was creating a projection that allows the user to step inside the object being projected on and view the shots from the characters point of view."
With these three ideas I believe that me and this student could work on some cool mapping project that uses the artistic aspects the student spoke of in the third idea to make a really cool visual experience for the viewers.
"I honestly don't feel like I know enough about the type of thing being proposed, so I have no idea how I would contribute. Although I do think 2 & 3 are worthy of the time and effort."
1. The student said he/she will prepare enough before doing a project. 2. Finding a way to clean water. Like to clean the rain water. 3. To build prototypes about collect water from the atmosphere.
"Your ideas reminded me of the LifeStraw (http://www.buylifestraw.com/). This technology allows people around the world to filter contaminated water and allow it to be instantly drinkable through a straw. I think in a semester or two, a group of students could take a LifeStraw, and build on it even more somehow. Maybe use the same technology to where, instead of drinking from a straw, make a fast and easy way to clean and store this water instead for later usage."
I very much enjoy the idea of the rain water collecting building. We take for granted of the water supply we get in America even though some part of the country is hurting from trouts and lack of water. For an idea that gather rain water for usage is a pretty good idea. The facility can be build in an area that is rich with rain during certain time of the year like Florida or Washington. If you can collect the water then filter and a way to distribute it it would be really helpful.
I would definitely partner up on this project since it is about a subject that is very important in life and for society to have clean running water is very important.
Yes this student made a sincere effort to explain their ideas. One of their projects was about scanning magic cards and projecting some type of holographic image. The other was to make a portfolio of all the work they have completed and also a short animation film.
"This student has some great ideas, especially the studio idea. I would use my skills in web-development and programming to help out in any way I could to get a studio going."
Idea 1 is to make a stop motion video using action figures. Idea 2 is create an interface that would allow magic cards to become 3D mapped on to the field. Idea 3 is create a portfolio of all the artwork and projects they have created.
"I really like the Magic idea, at the moment the streams of Magic Invitationals are rather boring but adding in the spectacle of the 3D rendering could really ramp up the entertainment."
"Three things were pretty clearly proposed. The stop-motion idea is intriguing, as is the holograph-magic card idea (even if it's a little derivative of the yugi-oh anime). And the portfolio development sounds like a really awesome idea."
"I'd love to collaborate on any of these projects, Doing concept sketches of possible characters for the magic cards, or helping to sculpt creatures for the stop-motion animation sound awesome. spending a semester working with other artists and collaborating on creating our individual portfolios and having that input from other artists sounds so beneficial."
This person made a sincere effort and proposed three ideas. The first was to create a stop motion film. The second was to create an interface that scans and 3D prints magic cards. The third was to generate a personal portfolio.
"I like the idea of creating an interface that would create 3D prints of magic cards. Ever since I was little when I use to collect pokemon cards and yugioh cards, I always thought it would be amazing if they had something that I could scan my cards with and that would put them into a game or something. To this day they don't really have anything like that as far as for card games. I know they have Skylanders which sort of does the same thing but for action figures."
"This entry suggests a website that builds on the great commercial success of JK Rowling's series of books and movies. 
 
 The interaction by the reader with the capability of creating their pathway is enticing for people."
"This entry is direct and to the point meeting the need of immediate satisfaction that this world now craves.
 
 It meets the challenge by explaining the site in a clear fashion without emotion yet allows the excitement of the fan world to glimpse through the basic unemotional descriptions."
"Interesting choice of future book. The strengths of your entry are in the wide variety of uses for blogs as well as examples for them. You have done a lot of research, and it shows. 
 
 The blog meets the challenge of future book by being a never ending, ever-evolving work of text contributed to by many."
Wow! Those are quite the concepts for reading in the future. You have listed a variety and their uses today and in the time to come.
"Anything Star Wars is an automatic win in my book, and I'm all for retro feels. The physical description of the book and its contents is clear, and taking the reader through the steps of how the images change is helpful to understand what makes this book special."
Fantastic description of the capabilities and (likely endless) possibilities of tumblr. Thorough representation of how you feel tumblr is changing the face of books/lit related media and the features available to bloggers.
"Excellent description of the features, functionality, and purpose of Pottermore website. I had heard of it before, but always considered it to be a stagnant wiki for the Potter 'verse. It was enlightening to know that Rowling continues to participate. I think your description of how this is part of the future of books was laid out well using this specific example."
"Excellent fact backup and mini-history of audio-blogging/podcasting. Section 3 is well thought out and highlights the pitfalls of a physical printing process, while underscoring the viability of podcasts as a literary medium. Bonus points for the use of ""bourgeois""."
Completed assignment on time.
"What a great example! I had no idea what to write about in my description and think that you chose the perfect media. You've provided a ton of information in your 300 word allotted space. There definitely isn't much ""fluff""- you get down to business from the start. I wish I had a better grasp of what this technology is, as I then think that this would be an extremely informative explanation. Your knowledgable of this type of media is apparent in your description and I learned something new by reading your assignment. 
 
 
 
 You seem confident in your prediction of the future of the book and readers of your assignment cannot deny the contagiousness of your excitement."
"Your summary is great - straightforward and provides the necessary information to understand your idea of the future of books. You chose a very interesting subject matter and I'm excited to check out www.postsecret.com in my free time.
 
 
 
 Your 300 word description is extremely clear and easy to follow. The time that you spent working on this assignment is apparent. You gave a great description of the book itself and allowed your readers to have a grasp of your personal experience with the book and how it changed the way you 
 
 
 
 My favorite line of your description is the following: ""The book is colorful and dark, emotional and boring, fantastic and dull.""
 
 
 
 I love the following line as well: ""What makes this book afuture book is that it doesnt have a single author. It is more like an interactive blog or news feed on an internet social media sight than an actual book."" I wouldn't have linked this book with the ever-popular social media world, but your point is great and so true.
 
 
 
 Overall, I don't think that your assignment needs much revising. You did a great job with the rough draft and looks more like a final draft to me than a rough draft!
 
 
 
 I look forward to reading and critiquing your future assignments for this course!"
"You gave a great summary of the work that you chose to be the future of books. Your quick snippet of a description is clear and purposeful. Your readers have a great grasp on what they are about to read in your description.
 
 
 
 I love that you included a link in your description and have every intention on visiting the website in my free time to learn more about ""Click-Clack the Rattlebag"".
 
 
 
 My favorite sentences of your assignment were the following:'Click-Clack the Rattlebag is a book in name only. Its text is entirely invisible, you see: invisible like ghosts. And thus, aesthetically,Click-Clack is a work of art presented entirely in vocal narrative."" As a reader, you definitely got me interested in the media that you chose to explore and the eerie ""Click-Clack the Rattlebag""."
"Wow! I absolutely love that you included a picture with your summary. It made your assignment come alive and was obviously the first thing that I noticed when I clicked on the title of your work. Not only did you include a picture, but it's a very interesting picture! Just by reading your summary, I got super curious as to what experiencing ""touch"" would be like on pottermore.com. I didn't know such a website existed about the Harry Potter series but am not surprised! I only read a couple of the Harry Potter books (I've never been much into fiction) but am curious and excited to explore the website. It's great that you included the link within your writing.
 
 
 
 Your excitement of this media is apparent in your writing, and definitely string along your readers to read through your whole assignment. I love how you mentioned that the pottermore.com crashed during it's initial release, that you insist that this website is just ""that cool.""
 
 
 
 I love that you realized the following: ""While it is not a replacement for the tome-like books, it brings a flair that is impossible to experience with paper alone."" (My assignment is based on this idea as well.)
 
 
 
 I think my favorite line of your assignment was the following: ""If this website could be neatly bound, pressed, and fitted with a dust jacket, it might be the most perfect book of the future."" You realize that even though the website is super cool, there is still a need for tangible bound books. I agree!"
"The entry specifically points to the book's uniqueness, in that it is not necessarily just an e-book or a website; it is her brand. This meets the assignment's challenge by being both specific and creative by finding a book that is very atypical."
"This is highly imaginative and definitely something that would be a fun, interactive experience for any reader. It meets the challenge by turning a book into a video game, something that is surely being worked on by the creators of e-books and web-books."
"Using a PostSecret book is a great choice. It is compiled of thousands of people's work, making it a unique, collaborative project (that, somehow, still keeps its secrets). The explanation of the future factor is spot on: it is a blog in a book, and surely a medium that will evolve into something great."
"The book promoted truly does break down barriers of storytelling, as the author states. It is a wonderful example of the future book, and giving many examples of its strengths makes the entry very convincing. Additionally, the author's telling is both engaging and compelling."
"I really like how you pointed out, in the beginning of your explanation, that you do not think books will ever die. I think this is important because, it keeps in mind that yes, although documentary film is becoming an extremely popular way for information to be transferred, it is not going to replace the traditional method of exchanging information. It also allows for books to remain special and sacred, and to stay an outlet for those who want to ˜disappear into their own world. This being said, you make an excellent point in stating that film is very relatable as it is easy to SEE another individual, and thus experience aspects of their lives with them. I also think you did a very good job explaining the film and in explaining the intrigue and the value in its genre as a documentary."
"I agree with you that sites such as tumblr are growing to be exponentially popular. In addition to liking and reblogging photos, users can reblog and critique or praise an individual's work, which includes but is not limited to: art,photography, music, poetry, and short stories. Because there is potential for re-blogging content, if an individual posts exceptional work, their work is likely to become extremely popular on the site, which can be a very good thing for the original poster. I think that many people who use tumblr use the site for the exact purpose of discovering and connecting to other people's posts, opinions, and self-created work."
"I think you did an excellent job of building up this book. You made the book seem very intriguing, exciting, and above all, futuristic. I have no idea how you managed to include pictures, but the pictures certainly did an amazing job of enhancing the work and proving your overall point. Through viewing the photos alone, and without reading any of your text, I got the feel that this book is incredibly different than other 'traditional' books, and in this I think you absolutely met the challenge of this assignment. I think that, in your final draft, your photos will do an outstanding job at proving your point. In addition to this, your writing was well-thought out, properly organized, and succeeded in dynamically building up the book you chose. Great work!"
"I honestly do not believe you need to embellish upon your original draft before it is finalized; your work was clear, concise, and to the point, as well as implanting an interest and an intrigue in not only the work you described, but also in a genre of books that follows the style of your chosen work. I wouldn't change anything to this draft, so good job!"
"I do agree that websites such as Reddit are not only very popular now, but will also continue to be popular in the future. People want a way to interact with one another, and also want to find individuals who share certain interests. As you said, it is not just text that is used on Reddit, but also pictures. In addition, people can also bring in other information to help others out or to just share interesting experiences, and I think that people of todays generations and in future generations really enjoy that autonomy in writing and reading."
"I believe that this description of the Role-Playing book was sufficient in answering the prompt questions. In addition, the OP made the Role Playing book seem exciting, challenging, and subjective to one's decisions and preferences, which many individuals will most certainly enjoy. The book is also not limited, it seems, to a physical, hand-held book, and can also be read and 'played' on e-devices, making it accessible from many different locations and in many different ways. The reader will be in control of the outcome of the ending, which can be a delightful experience for many individuals who prefer this type of book."
"The article is well-written and accurately describes the subject matter and how it can be seen in the future of the book, particularly in the realm of fan-author interactions."
"The links are very helpful for anyone who isn't immediately familiar with the app, and the Future Factor of the material is stated very clearly."
"The article is very well written and gives the reader a good understanding of the nature of the Pottermore website. Adding the detail about the site crashing on launch is also a great way to show that it's not just the author who feels positive about this sort of continuation of printed works in the digital realm, as is comparing it to other popular social media."
"The author does an excellent job of both describing the material, making it sound almost irresistible to readers, and explaining why this book exemplifies how technology will shape the future of the book. Providing the link to the material in question is also quite nice."
"The article is very well-rounded and addresses many valid points about blogs and how they reflect the changing nature of writing online, publishing online, and the closer interactions between reader and writer."
"""Annarasumanara"" is a Korean variation on the many Japanese web-based, comic-book style stories that grew out of the Manga and Anime and comics of a few decades ago and that have now become rendered as graphically enhanced software that can be displayed on computer screens. The strength of this entry is that it does demonstrate an important aspect of the continuing evolution of books by showing us an example of one segment of the ""reading pool"" that is now making the transition from print to digital format."
"This is quite an interesting interpretation of the intent of this assignment. Using DNA testing as a way to build a historical thread that can possibly reveal long-lost relatives from the past, or perhaps uncover historical facts about people that might help to strengthen filial bonds (or not!) certainly identifies an application of a current technology (genetic and genome analysis) that can be used in a very positive way. And the translation of the data collected into electronic formats will make it more likely that information converted from printed and pictorial media will be stored in a centralized place, with a reasonably high chance surviving for a very long time. You seem to be agreeing, then, that the eventual transformation of knowledge and information, including books, from the printed formats of today to more digitized forms is not only occurring, but will continue to happen until one day nearly all of our reading interactions will take place through a human-machine, electronic interface."
"This is a very good example of a current technology that is moving us closer to a time when written information is created, edited, refined, developed, critiqued, and stored in an Internet-based, 'cloud-like' environment. In a direction divergent from social-networking websites such as Facebook -- and as the author of this entry has explained -- Tumblr demonstrates one of the ways in which our book and information technology is changing from one based on printed materials to one based in a digital universe. Human interactions here are and will rely on man-machine interfaces that may eventually eliminate the need for printed copies of nearly everything. This example also welcomes wild speculation about the way humans will be exchanging information in the future!"
"Kali's selection of ""Night Film"" for her entry for the field guide is presented very well and the embedded images provide visuals that help the reader understand the unusual characteristics of this book. Although scores of other authors have incorporated illustrations, graphs, images, codes, and other visual devices to enhance the reader's experience in 'living' the story, the merging of information that provides the reader with links and other interfaces to the Internet, the importance this additional information has to the story lines and the need to download an external decoder, while possibly annoying to some readers, is in itself an example of how the current technology of the book is using the wonders of the digital age in incorporating some of its interfaces as an integral part of the book."
"Kali's obvious skill at presenting ideas and information -- as her adeptness in articulating opinions in our discussion posts has already been demonstrated -- will be an advantage as she further develops the idea she has proposed in this first draft of her field guide. Hopefully, she will also include some thoughts on how the techniques used by Pessl in ""Night Film"" will evolve as the technologies for interacting with data and ideas (particularly 3-dimensional) progress to the point in which readers feel more like travelers through a parallel universe -- feeling the same sensations experienced by characters in the story -- than outsiders looking in."
"This is another good example of a book that uses current digital technology to enhance a reader's interactive experience (in this case, a children's book designed to be read on an iPad using iBooks as the e-reading application. Although printed books have provided an excellent medium to display vivid illustrations and bright colors for children, it is not until books began to be digitized and designed to be read on electronic reading devices that animations, voices, and movement -- all of which greatly enhance a child's interaction with a story -- that features such as the author has described are now possible. Selecting a children's book in demonstrating possible directions for the future of books provides ample room to speculate on what may be in the realm of possibility within the next decade and, indeed, within the next century."
It does show how things we did in the past are now improved or changed as a result of technological advances. I clearly understand the point the author is making and the writing is clearly thought-out.
The field guide closely follows the prompt and finds a new type of way to engage with books through some sort of future or new technology. The guide explains the process of emerging existing texts into a more immersive reality and has made me want to download the app on mu iPhone.
"Kudos for using futuristic implementations into the field guide, like the hyperlink to News from Gardenia's Unbound site and the picture. The Field Guide does well to sell its audience on News from Gardenia which is a book about the possibility of a utopian future. The author of the guide accurately and with concise but important detail, gives an accurate description of the thing they are writing on."
The field guide describes Reddit very well and points out all the aspects of Reddit that make it something that answers the prompt's questions. The field guide creates even for someone who knows nothing about Reddit a well thought out description enabling them to use the site.
The selected thing from which the Field Guide is created follows the prompt perfectly. The description in the field guide explains what has changed in the books adaptation and these changes are a result in new technologies and advancements made.
"The technologies described definitely seem to provide a more immersive experience for the reader. Especially ""Alice,"" with its ability to provide a previously unheard of level of interactivity with the story itself. The selections point toward an emerging technology meant to work with the existing book itself to make it something new. It meets the challenges of the assignment by detailing how these products enhance the reading experience in a variety of ways (social, interactive, and reviews). It also hints toward how these technologies might be expanded upon in the future, to further change the reading experience."
"This entry very effectively describes the ergodic text, ""House of Leaves,"" and how it utilizes unorthodox methods of story-telling to give voice to several characters. The features detailed make the prospect of reading a text of such innovative design very enticing. It is representative of how certain authors are now bushing the limitations of the traditional book to tell stories in a way few could have previously imagined."
"This sounds like an amazing companion to one of the, if not the, most popular book series' in history. The Harry Potter series enjoyed immense popularity before it ever graced a movie screen. There are few modern series' that have managed to hold the public attention in such large numbers for seven books and eight film adaptations. I can only imagine how immersive and how much fun this site would be for a Harry Potter fan. I think this description really gives the reader a sense of the level of content on the site. As well as several examples of the interesting and creative content they can expect to find when they visit it. For an fan, after reading that description, I can only imagine that their next stop would be Pottermore.com."
"Fair warning: This is my second review about this site. I feel this description did a very good job of highlighting the social features of the site and the additional literary content, in the form of fan fiction and the small additions from Rowling, which would definitely be a draw for any die hard Harry Potter fan. Combined with the continual development of additional story content in the games and the ability to stay in contact with J.K. Rowling herself. It definitely appears that Pottermore.com would be the number one place to go to immerse one's self in the Harry Potter universe."
I believe you've made a strong point here about the similarity between documentary and informational text. There is a natural connection in the way that the information is delivered. Video in a how-to or documentary style may very well replace their textbook or informational text counterparts in the future. This is one of the few types of books I believe is on the way out.
"This entry goes in depth to explore how podcasts offer the same experience of reading a book but with the added benefit of being able to multi-task. It effectively explains what a podcast is, who uses them, and why they are important. It also uses several very specific examples to strengthen its assertions."
"The only suggestion I would have is to make mention of the millions of different types of podcasts are out there. There is truly a podcast for everybody. This would give readers a reason to seek out podcasts. I know a lot of people who are intimidated by them just because they don't understand what they are, or that there are podcasts out there that cater to their interests."
"This is an extremely well-written entry, with enough excellent description to make anybody want to read (or here, listen to) this story. It highlights a very relevant piece, one which blends the custom of stories with the ""second orality"" we are focusing on. The writer of this entry appeals to ""the illiterate and the bibliobibuli alike,"" stating the advantages of such a form of literature in the modern world. A great entry!"
"I've read and reread this entry trying to find something to suggest an improvement on, and I can't find it. This is a great entry and I think it accomplished everything it was meant to."
This is a very interesting take on the future of the book -- the focus on an interactive future is exciting. I think this entry presents an excellent argument for the futuristic digitalization of literature. It effectively describes the benefits of such technology and why it is an important option for our literary future.
"This entry wonderfully blends the arts of printed books and digital media, must like the subject itself. It is clear that the writer supports the idea of digital media as an enhancer of printed text, rather than a complete replacement, which is something I completely relate to. This entry effectively describes the content of the story without being over-revealing, and it describes the ways in which the story is a glimpse into the future of literature."
I think this entry does a great job of answering each of the questions and meeting the requirements of the assignment. I am absolutely inspired as a reader to experience this work for myself.
"I think this entry very effectively describes what makes ""Annarasumanara"" different from other e-texts, and therefore a ""future"" book rather than one we already know. The author picks out a specific characteristic of this web comic (the noticeably different format and disregard to the uniformity consistent with other web comics) to distinguish it from others and propose it as a futuristic text. It also gives readers an idea of what the web comic is about, and makes us curious to know more about the characters and story line."
"Great choice of film! I love the documentary Babies, and I think you hit upon its main unique strength here in a very eloquent way. Rather than use text at all to communicate its message, it relies specifically on non-verbal cues and images throughout the film. I really like how you mention that if you glance away for a moment, you can miss a part of the story, as that is very true for that film and for so many social cues which are non-verbal. I think this brings up all sorts of great questions, because if this film is a sort of future book it seems more a type of oral culture than literary culture. Indeed, it would seem that almost all documentary films are, in a way, more a throwback to an oral culture than literary culture. I think you've hit on an interesting idea here."
"Wow, this is definitely a double-future dose. Literally future-esque, as in its subject matter, and then the figuratively future-esque of the assignment, with the Unbound Publishing. I'm a big reader and I hadn't heard of Unbound, so very cool!
 
 
 
 I love your description of the book, as you point out right away what makes the subject matter of the book unique--the isn't the same old dystopian novel, but a utopian novel where we aren't all subject to the same old gloom and doom. You point out the book's effects, that it has the ability to inspire people to make a better world, which I think is also important to make people want to run out and grab it. They know what its about, but what is it going to make them feel? So in several ways, you've found a very unique book. 
 
 
 
 I also appreciate that you are concise. In English classes I think we tend towards fancy language without saying a lot, and I think you use direct language here which conveys your message with the clarity the assignment wanted, something I know I had a hard time doing myself."
"Wow, the technologies I've critiqued thus far are crazy. I had no idea the ""future"" of the book was so advanced!
 
 
 
 This is a great choice of technology to feature, as it is obviously right on the pulse of the future.
 
 
 
 I like how you mention the possibilities with children quite a bit, as I think that is important, I know many children who already use iPads as reading tools and I can definitely see this as a possibility in the future.
 
 
 
 You also managed to explain everything in an eloquent way, there weren't any grammar errors in your writing that I could find, so great job on that as you are talking about some complicated tech topics here."
"The entry strengths are good because it explains how The secret lives of Men and Women can attract to people who want rather read from the internet. It challenges the assignment because it provides reasoning on why this would be the future book, such as how people adapt to social media and how this future book can relate to it."
The entry strengths are the detail explanation about the book. It meets the challenge of the assignment because it discuss and explains how this book can be a future book.
The reader gets a full understanding of what is being describe to be the future book. It meets the challenge of the assignment because it is explained and gives a good knowledge about why the role playing game and choose your own adventure game can be the future book.
I really think this post was good because it provided the book information in details and that it was an ebook. It met the challenge of the assignment because their was enough information to convince the reader about the future book and why it could be.
The strengths can be found in that there was a lot of good detail information to why the digital book is the future. It met the challenge of the assignment in proving reasons as to how the digital books will be the future books due to modern technology.
The author certainly supports that podcasts are a way forward for creative works. There are a number of outside sources within the Field Guide that support the idea that podcasts and recorded audio work in general could surpass the written word as a way to consume both fiction and non-fiction.
"The author does an excellent job in summarizing the appeal of the novel itself. In addition, the way the book is created, with crowdsourced financing and increased interaction between audience and author, is a compelling way forward for future publications."
"The author does an excellent job at describing the uniqueness of the work itself, as well as the visual style of the art. The ability to alter or eliminate the restrictions of the printed page is well-explained in how the work takes advantage of the lack of limitation in electronic form."
"This field guide entry does an excellent job in explaining Tumblr and how it can be used by authors and artists to distribute their craft. It also demonstrates how this can be effective in a changing electronic landscape, incorporating both multiple forms of media and reader-response into an ongoing product."
"The author does an excellent job focusing on a single work and expanding on the method that work uses in order to demonstrate how this can be used for a variety of works. Each aspect of the expanded website is well-explained and clear, and it's easy to see how this is a useful tool to expand the world of the novel."
"I love the way you portrayed the ongoing relationship a blog can establish between author and reader in theFuture Factor section and how it differs from that of a novel. You did a great job in your description as well, and made a compelling case as to why a blog can be considered afuture book."
"You did an excellent job with this assignment. Your descriptions were very clear and you made a compelling case as to why Pottermore is afuture book. I had never heard of it and you made me want to go check it out myself. You have a great tone to your writing that made your entry enjoyable to read. I love your last line and the idea of technology as a tool tofeed the fans, great imagery (and very accurate I believe). Fans are always hungry for more and are constantly searching for new ways to feed that hunger. Technology offers a great way for fans to connect with the author, as well as other people who have the same interests."
"I loved your entry! It was thoughtful and very creative. You have a great tone that makes your writing enjoyable to read. I loved the way you described the aesthetics of the book, invisible like a ghost. I also liked that you included Gaimans Halloween gift-giving tradition. That history gives the work more solidity. You did a great job in your description and made me want to go download it immediately. You also made a compelling case as to why this is aFuture Book. 
 
 Bibliobibuli is a great word by the way, I actually had to look that one up :)"
This was a great entry. Your description was excellent and by far your greatest strength in this assignment. It was very detailed and I could clearly imagine the book in my head.
"This was certainly the most creative idea I've read. The idea that we are all stories is one that I firmly believe. It's a great concept. I like the way you portrayed all the footprints we are creating through photographs, videos, facebook, twitter, instagram, etc. Our great grandchildren will have a far more accurate account of our story than we have of our own great grandparents. What I also like about this concept is that our stories never really end. Our story is part of our parents' story and our friends' stories and many other stories that are constantly overlapping and weaving together throughout the years."
"This entry provides a detailed account of the author's ""future"" book."
"This entry was very interesting, particularly for those who are interested in science fiction novels. The description of the book's synopsis is what makes it really captivating. The student started their description with a question bringing the reader in as if we were reading the back cover of the book."
"It was a very good entry with very little I can find wrong. The future factor is well described and I feel I have a grasp on what Unbound is all about. Additionally, the student explained why this way of writing publishing could be popular in the future. The student also gave us a taste of what his/her full field entry will look like with a clear and well lit picture. I suppose if I wanted to see anything more, it would be more about the history/inspiration of the book."
"This entry is actually very realistic and makes a convincing argument for the popularity of orality over reading with examples of existing podcasts and other media today. Similarly, although the future factor contains a lot of hypotheses there seems to be enough realism to make it believable such the expense of printing and digital."
"The students gives a wonderfully detailed description of his/her future book. The format was thoroughly explained enough for me to understand what I would be getting into without the student actually giving away the story. The student also made a great point in their future factor about how creative format books such as ""House of Leaves"" would not be able to be e-books or digitized."
The student has provided sufficient background for his/her future book as well as a convincing and believable argument as to why the format for such a book will become even more popular.
"The part about ""Alice"" met the challenge of the Assignment. I liked the idea of being in Hogwarts and walking around and looking at notes! Maybe the author could set these scenarios up in such a way that the curious are rewarded."
A very spirited campaign for the blog! I could see how reading a blog could approximate the book-reading experience for you.
This was a great example of a story in a new-ish format. It made me interested in seeing and reading the comic!
I think the subject of the field guide was well chosen. This is an interesting competitor in a very new and exciting space. You did a great job of conveying the sense of newness and excitement for the 3 different programs. I agree that interacting with books in the future could be heading in this direction.
"This entry provides a strong sense of what is means to be a future-ready book. I agree with the sentiment that readers in the future will want increased speed, technology, and convenience. The ebook or hybrid book definitely fits the speed, technology, and convenient requirement nicely."
"I love the connection to video games. Video games are growing in such a huge way that it would be easy to conceive of a distant future where movies, TV, and even literature take inspiration from them. This is a very fun and futuristic vision."
Excellent future factor! I have a few friends that hate reading and have switched exclusively to audio books(where possible). I have yet to listen to one but it is clear that this type of format is already catching on. Your particular entry sounds like an improvement on the traditional audio book. Good job.
"This entry focused on the Ideo, a really innovative technology. This entry delves into the specifics of Ideo, and the different concepts that they have developed. It is well-written, and a thoughtful post. It meets the challenges of the assignment by examining such an innovative concept."
"I really enjoyed this entry's selection for the assignment. It was innovative and interesting. The author takes a unique perspective by examining the children's book. As children thrive on constant stimulation, electronic devices are great for kids."
"This entry does an excellent job at incorporating images and text. The author clearly thought about this assignment, and the work is very well-written. The author selected an unique text, and successfully described the book's elements."
"This entry's strength lie in the last section. The production of the book is what makes it futuristic, and it is a coincident that the book also happens to be about the future. The author was also able to include an image, which makes the post stronger. The description section was written very creatively and sounded like something you would read off the back of the book."
"This entry's strength is in thinking outside of the box. I would have never examined a Post Secret book in a futuristic manner, but I understand the logic behind it after reading this entry. This author has a detailed explanation of postsecret.com that aides in understanding the concept. Overall, it is well-written."
This entry clearly defines the Pottermore website and its attributes as an extension of the Rowling series of books. It definitely could be viewed as a futuristic technological leap for books especially this type of story that has an epic quality too it and multiple books contained within a single story line.
The author clearly describes the book in great detail as far as its physical look and appearance and gives a good comparison helping the audience understand somewhat what scanimation is.
"I love how the author of the entry describes all the parts of the book that make it futuristic. It sounds like the book using the internet in a major way to tell the story and this integration of literature and internet technology definitely speaks to a the future direction of books. It sounds like a great read, I'll have to check out."
The author of this entry perhaps goes to far in re-telling the entire plot of the book. The entry is incredibly long and quite possibly far over the 500 word limit. A tighter description of the futuristic qualities of the book and a lot less plot telling would make the entry more successful as a field study guide. Right now it reads more like a book report.
"This entry does a great job of capturing the futuristic essence of ""The House of Leaves."" There is great descriptions and focus on the formatting of the text in the story. This appears to be the greatest example of the book's author's forward and futuristic thinking. This too, sounds like a great read."
There really isn't much to critique in the negative of this entry.
"The strength in this entry is definitely the hard fact that this concept and company are brand new to most of us reading the entry. The description and use of persuasive language in the description was exceptional. It made me want to watch the video for a second time.
 
 This meets the challenge of the assignment because it is simply an actual attempt at a company predicting the trajectory of where the future of the book will be."
"The strength of this entry is the writers passion for reddit. The writer seems very invested in this particular website, and states very vehemently that this site is already replacing books. 
 
 The entry meets the challenge because it is one of the specified examples in the assignment description."
"This entry's strength is it's description of the technology. While this is the second entry to describe a technology that interacts with books in the form of an app, it explains the technology in a way that I am able to picture in my mind.
 
 This meets the challenge of the assignment because it introduces the readers to a new way to interact with printed books."
"The strengths are definitely the added images. This is something that I forgot about in my assignment, and none of the other reviews that I'm doing are for entries that include pictures at all. I think that this entry did an excellent job enticing me to read the book. I agree that Pessl's ""Night Film"" can be described as a future book because of the extrasensory details that the book includes in order to involve the reader in the story.
 
 
 
 I think it meets the challenge of the assignment because it has expertly addressed every aspect of the project and made me want to go out and read this book!"
"I would have been interested to read an entry about something other than the style of books that we've already been reading in class, which is what I felt this entry felt like. I don't really have anything else to suggest, I think this article was done really well and its the best one that I reviewed!"
"This entry meets the challenge of the assignment because I believe that it is a representation of a future book, albeit for personal reasons only."
"I think that the author of this entry was feeling very strong about the book that s/he chose. This allowed for a more passionate feeling about the book which makes the reader of this entry want to read the book and to see the accompanying film and apps! I think its really cool that this book has other platforms that go along with it aside from just different pictures like we saw in ""A Dodo at Oxford"". This ties the book to more recent modes of media which I found very interesting."
I think the subject of this entry is very interesting and is something that I would enjoy taking a look at. Its also a reference to some iconic pop culture which I think will still be relevant in the future. I think this meets the challenge of the assignment because it ties together the past and the future in a way that I think could be relevant for anyone.
"This entry is about documentaries with a primary focus on the ""Babies"" documentary film. I liked this entry because I felt like it gave a different spin on the project while still meeting the assignment. This is definitely an example of the future of the book. I could see people in the future choosing to watch documentaries to learn about things instead of reading books. As it is, things like furniture and special dog collars already come with DVDs to show you how to use them correctly."
"I really enjoyed the description of how Gaiman reads the script of the book. I thought the summary was straight and to the point as it should have been - easy to understand and immediately know what I was going to read about. As someone familiar with Gaiman's style, but who has not listened to this book, the description of his ""acting"" skills piqued my interested in the project and made me go and physically look up the project online after I finished reading the entry, so I feel that that aspect of the description was well done. It was also helpful to find out a bit of the background of the book, which unlike many other stories is very unique. (which was also an aspect of the assignment, just as the voice of the piece and attempting to motivate people to go and read the piece was). I also felt that the last line of the future section was particularly effective and was a lovely way to end the section by tying in themes of the Gaiman's pieces."
"I think the piece is off to a very good start, in general I think there are just a few places that could be expanded upon with some greater detail. As the author mentions the presentation of the book is unique as an audio book, so in addition the description of Gaiman's voice as the author has done which is very well done, the argument would benefit from describing how that unique experience of being read to instead of reading; not being separated from the author by your own voice, pacing, and tone of reading, or physical page, but instead almost having a ""tangible"" connection to the author and the authors voice changes the reading experience as only an audio book can. Doing so would help to further drive home the point that audio books are a entirely unique experience. I would have also like to have a scene a little bit of a deeper analysis on how audio books could expand reading in the future - again, drive home the point that this format can uniquely change the reading experience over other mediums, not just save time as the author rightfully mentioned."
"I specifically thought the description that focused on the Alice program was direct, easy to follow and clearly showed how the program furthered the reading experience through an immersive experience for the reader - it was the most effective and impactful description and really showed how books can incorporate future technology in order to evolve."
"I greatly appreciated the use of senses to describe the unique elements of the website in the description section - I also wrote about Pottermore and that was not something I had thought about including in my own description but it really helped to sell the complete atmosphere the site provides not just in content but all the way to its attention to ambiance, which is something unique to web and audio formats that can not be included in the book. The sensory details helped set the stage for the following descriptions of the types of activities users can participate in on the site, helping to show how immersive and expansive the site is and truly showing how individual it is. The summary is also very clear and direct, the reader knows exactly what the entry will be about and what to expect in the following sections."
"I thought the description of just what makes Pottermore a future book was well crafted and straight to the point. Not only did it show how it represents something new in the formatting and use of books by explaining the interactive websites use as a digital extension of the printed world to be used in conjunction with the books, but it mentioned why this was successful - people depend upon technology. In the other posts I have read, not many authors focused on why their type of book was sustainable and successful for the future of books; this post did in an well though out sentence. Such an explanation helps to solidify the potential of this type of medium and why it could feasibly be incorporated into other books and other genres as people become more and more familiar with and dependent upon technology."
"I thought the focus on the emotional reaction of the reader based on the text was intriguing and a very interesting way to show readers that the future of the books does not necessarily have to involve technology in a traditional way. The descriptions of the multiple formats and uses of texts (and their purposes) truly showed not only the versatility of font and format, but its importance, and just how deeply the presentation of words in a story can effect the readers emotional well being or reflect the state of the character or the world of the book in a visceral way. The idea that the technological advances of books does not have to mean their conversion to ebooks or their forced incorporation of technology was interesting and well presented."
The strength of your rough draft is that you explained the usages of a blog very thoroughly and what a blog encompasses.
"The strength of your draft are that you clearly describe the journey of Emily C. chronologically detailing her story as a vegan, among other aspects of that such as including recipes. I also found it strong that you mentioned howe-books are the wave of the future and the items that are now extinct that once captured memories."
The strength of your article is that you clearly described the benefits of a hybrid book and contrasted it with an actual book to where I could understand why you would prefer a hybrid book.
"The only thing that I would offer as a grammatical change is to not begin a paragraph with the word ""it"". Everything was wonderful as far else as I could see. The entire assignment flowed very well and was interesting."
"Your strength in your rough draft was that you kept my interest and I desired to look up the site that you cited. Everything flowed very well and I think this is an exciting way to jump off from a book into the technology aspect, as not everyone has a computer, but if they desire to go farther than a book, they have the option to do so. Our discussion boards are very similar, as gaining insight from each other aids in our learning and understanding. You taught me something with this, as I did not know it even existed, my mother still goes to book clubs at the local library, and this would definitely prove more convenient."
"I did not find any weaknesses in your paper, as I stated previously, everything flowed very well and you held my interest."
The motion matches the description from everything that I can see. However I believe we were told to come up with some sort of description that was more story-related. In this case maybe the walker is a person with paranoia who runs when he thinks something is coming after him. Otherwise this sketch does what it is described and I love the screen wrapping.
Motion depicts the description ! running period can be increased to make it distinct.the difference between walking and running will be more noticeable apart from color change.
"The description matches the patch exactly. Great job, I like the idea of it being a bird."
"Yes, the motion matches the description. I see the blue as the bird falls and then the green rotating rectangle as it tries to fly, then the motion is repeated on a loop."
The motion matches the description very well as it definitely seems like a bird is continually falling and trying to fly. the different states do a fine job to mimic this.
"The motion matched the description very well. After reading the description, I felt that the different rectangles became different people. Their movement were unique and vivid that gave the ""street""(the window) life. Also he used different color changed when a new column of rectangle showed up. Very impressive."
"Yes, because the squares are moving in the upward direction but stopping every now and then to ""sidestep"" and then continue in the upward direction."
"It matches. The rectangle moves very slowly for 3 seconds and then starts moving fast. When it exceeds the top, it appears again at the bottom and changes a color."
"The motion satisfies the purpose of the assignment, though there are no constraints to limit its movement inside the screen."
"Yes, the description matches the animation perfectly."
"Yes the sketch does match the description above for this project. I think this is a great project that had a lot of effort put into it, and the objects really do look like butterflies with various rectangle shapes fluttering around and ""showing up"" one right after the other. They do stay within a small access, while still fluttering randomly."
Haha! This is awesome and very creative. Their movements are very much like butterflies. motion matches the description.
"Yes. The motion matches the description. I liked the description, it was funny. The rectangle does exactly as it says, staggering to the exit."
The motion that I see matched the behavior in Question 2 because the movement of the character goes to the bottom left and then stays idle.
The animation matches the description and I think the changing colors as the direction changes is also a very nice touch. It matches the behavior in that the walker goes straight then changes direction as it hits a wall.
"Yes it does, it walks forward and then bounces off of the walls. I like that you used random with the colors, it makes an interesting design as it builds upon itself."
"Yes, the motion does match the description of the behavior. I like how it changes color to indicate a different line is being walked by ""the blind person"" every time they bump into a wall. Or even the Rumba description is spot on with your code."
The both the creative description and coding description match exactly with what is occurring in this code. It is a fun description and the amount of detail you used in both explanations is very well done.
"Yes, the cool walker does move more vertically and the warm walker moves more horizontally. They both stay in the box and move about randomly and quickly."
The motion matches the description in Question 2 because the character overlap constantly with their consistent colors.
"Yes, the description matches the motion well. The red, raging parolee frantically paces in his home, quickly filling all the available space. Then it bolts from the home. It is a very nice looking animation, and becomes pretty funny when the story is told."
The animation clearly shows that someone is pacing back and forth which perfectly resembles someone who is on house arrest.
Yes because the rectangles are all centered in the window and continues to stay in that area for a considerable amount of time.
"The motion represented by the sketch matched the description of behavior in the assignment. The walker would turn more and more red each frame that progressed, until the 30 seconds were up. As soon as the time was up, the walker started to turn cyan like it was supposed to. It also started going around, but at a certain point, it went off screen and I didn't see it again."
The behavior seems to exhibit the described actions just fine.
"Yes. The motion matches the description. It starts slow, speeds up, slows, speeds up... It worked exactly how it is described."
"Yes, it sort of reminded me of fireworks, the way it explodes for 4 seconds and fireworks sort of leave a trail of smoke after it's done and then you have to load up the next firework so it stays in it's spot for 2 seconds and waits for it to be shot up."
The patch matches the description very well. Awesome job.
It seems match the description. I can see both the rotation and the moving of the walker. But I'd like to see which kind of character does this walker looks like.
"It really does. Mainly talking about the end there, you don't need an explanation to see that it looks like bubbly water spouting out from the ground. Nicely done."
The movement is a cool and funny one and it meets all the requirements.
It sure does match it. The description is pretty clever and fitting to what I saw. Good job!
"Yes. The walker acts normal within a specific area until prompted, and then returns to normal afterwards. I like the mouse movement incorporation."
"I think this patch excellently mimics the description given. Upon reading the description I was a bit skeptical as to whether or not it would look like the motion. But when loading the patch, it fits it very well and is also extremely entertaining to interact with."
This is one of my favorites; it's very different. You did a really good job depicting the fluttering wings and the basic movement of a fly. Good job.
"Yes, the motion matches the description well. It is obviously a fly. While sometimes the fly flies backwards, the twitchy erratic flight and the size changes really sell it."
The sketch exhibits the described behavior very well.
Yes. The motion described is performed by the rectangle.
"Yes it does match the description above. The lines of squares are moving from the top to the bottom right corner looking like a lightening bolt. I also like the transparent blue that they made. When I clicked the mouse and held it down the squares turned red, but when I released it went back to blue."
"The actions of the walker are described well, my only suggestion is when the walker goes off screen have it come through the other sider and not towards the middle."
The walker matches the behavior in that it stays still while moving slightly for a while before 'jumping' to a close by area. With the strokeWeight it gives the walker a cool fading effect that adds to the jumping idea.
Good job! The walker matches the description very well. It moves in a small area for a short while and then jumps to a new spot on the screen. It was obvious that the code was original and easy to understand.
Yes. The character seems to move in any direction and it also returns to the center when it goes out of the 500x500 boundry.
"Yes, it does create the look of hand drawn spirals. I thought your use of expanding the radius was neat."
The crazy colorful motions do match the description you gave for your walkers behavior.
"Yes, it does, I like how you were able to use the millis(), I had a hard time understanding how to make that work."
"The motion described is actually described pretty well, and with your description it actually made the program come alive more than it normally would. You used the colors of the rect to help the viewer go deeper into your narrative, and it helps the viewers imagination create a world in their own heads using your sketch, This is a good mix of art and programming."
"Yes, it does seem like the walker is running around before circling in the same spot then running around randomly again."
"The assignment matches the description, it works well in that the rapid movements are done with larger squares while the smaller circling movements are matched with smaller squares."
Felt like I just had opened a pop up window on the internet inviting me to play a game.
It's wonderful. The sounds are entertaining and grasp the meaning of positivity and negativity.
The approach is perfect. I learned that UI and presentation mode in Max is very critical to developing a successful patch.
"This patch is very similar to that of the patch we went over in class. The good key and bad key branches are the same with two sfplay~ messages, two meters, two ezdac~ messages, minus the different sounds that correspond to each of them. There is also a comment box that says ASCII value for the intended ASCII number code."
The way how this patch was approached was the same way as the patch that we went over in class. Something that was different that I saw was the addition of the comment speech bubble. I did not know that that was a way that comments can be presented and is definitely something that I learned.
The patch is very simple and it's easy to understand the signal flow.
The patch looks very clean and well put together.
"The patch works perfectly, the D key plays back a ringing bell while all the other keys play back a snair drum."
"The patch is impressive and works well, I think that they even added in some extra steps along the way that made the patch even a little cooler."
"It feels great to use. The sounds are simple and quick, making it easy to identify what key I've hit. The sounds end quickly which gives enough of a response to know if I hit the right key or not."
The patch looks simple and logical.
"The experience is simple and mechanical with little conceptual salience, but there's still a sense of elementary investment in the patch's function. I'm happy when I hear the ""success"" song instead of the ""failure"" song."
"There isn't any major technical innovation here, but everything works fine."
The look of the patch is very organized and easy to understand.
Very simple and easy to read vertically from top to bottom. Same as in class.
"The patch looked very nice and professional. It seemed to contain all the correct pieces and buttons so based on appearance, I would give it an A."
"I thought the sounds were very creative. Now I had my volume on super loud so my first press and the ""W"" key was a bit shocking but after the initial shock I was good. The sounds themselves were actual song pieces which I really enjoyed. It was entertaining, energetic, and I would have fun playing around with this patch."
"This particular patch looks very professional to me. It is as cleaned up as it can be. As I have said, I did enjoy the fact that they added songs in place of a voice for the yes and no key. Did I learn how it was done based on the patch itself, no. However, I am no eager to do so. Honestly, there is not much more to be done to this patch to perfect it. It's self explanatory and easy as can be."
The patch was simple and easy to navigate. The sounds are entertaining.
"The patch appears to be very nice, and well put together."
The patch works fine and emits both a yes and a no sound.
The patch is good it takes two different types of sound to play which is a good mix.
this is a good patch it combines two different type of sound and its cool to listen to.
The buttons used are great and they get the job done right with the sounds. The no sound is a simple gong which is better than just saying no and the yes button is cheerful music like the type you receive when you beat a level in a video game.
This patch was very clean and put together nicely. All components were accurately described and neatly placed.
It's very simple. Text states clearly how to make the patch function and what it will do.
"It's entertaining. The laughter provokes memories. The ""bad key"" is kind of creepy while the ""good key"" is humorous."
Pretty simple patch. Not complicated to look at.
The good key is pretty entertaining with the beavis and butthead laugh.
It was just like the example in class.
"Looks similar to the example in class, easy to follow, uses the open features along with the names of the files."
"Very entertaining to use, made me laugh just like the patch did, and it was easy to tell which key was the odd one out."
"The audio was the most surprising thing, most of the patch looked similar to the class example but it was the audio that made it unique."
It's pretty basic and straightforward. Lots of notes to let you know what's going on. Simple.
The look and feel is simple.
"The ""no"" sound was startling, and the ""yes"" sound was comedic and nice to hear."
Looks and feels very similar to the patch built in class.
the good key sound is very entertaining.
the formula shown in class was used in this assignment.
"Before even using the patch, I could tell that program would run smoothly. It was well laid out and designed, nice and clean."
"After playing with the patch, I thought it was fun. I liked the user's sounds a lot. I could tell the user is a goofy person because when you found the good key, it played the ""oooh-yeah,"" from Ferris Bueller's Day Off."
"The patch technically speaking was basically the same layout as instructed in class. However, they did a good job overall. I especially liked the sound files."
"The patch is very clean, everything is laid out in straight lines and is extremely easy to understand. There are no unnecessary elements in the patch."
"It's a very simple patch, it's easy to understand the signal flow."
"The patch is a simple variation of the assignment, and looks very clean. It is structure neatly from top to bottom and I know how the patch flows."
"The patch was simple and straight forward with an ease of design. They did add a ""victory"" and ""loser"" aside to a ""yes"" or ""no"" which added to the whole video game music choice. I did do a similar design and structure."
This patch looks different from the other ones I've looked at so far. It was definitely interesting. I would assume this person has prior knowledge of Max as this patch appears to be a bit more advanced. It was set up as a project with multiple folders instead of a single patch.
"I think that the patch that you made is pretty clean, and unique. I didn't see the selective key in that which is an excellence idea to hide it."
"I think that the coolest thing of your work is that you used the sub patch, so you are able to hide the ""Good key"" form the user."
simple yet obviously complex
they did something nobody else did. a step up from the orig. assignment.
"This look is completely different from the rest of the patchers i have seen today and it is very unique and makes me wonder what it will do, it comes with instructions on how to use it and it has a short simple design."
Pretty simple patch. Not complicated.
"The patch is clear and easy to use. I like that there is a button that I can press to activate the wav files instead of hunting for thegood Key, or an ascii code map. I like the meter and the level meter attached to the sfplay object, it helps to know that the sound is playing."
"I like the patch, it is clean and simple. I like the color sound meter."
I love the sound. The audio is an actual person talking not just tones.
The overall feeling I got when looking at the patcher was that it was cleanly laid out. My personal preference would be to line up the edges of the bottom boxes with the edges the message patches above. A minor point!!!
0
"The coding assignment was formatted and completed the same way as it was done in class, but there was an additional sound meter added.
 
 
 
 They could have left comments such as what key number 97 is."
"I think that the patch that you made is clean, and well organized."
"I love the music that you picked. The quality of the sound is pretty good, and the style is really unique, and not clichÃ©. I'm really enjoy playing this interactive."
"Looks like the class example, clean and easy to read. only thing that differs a bit is the volume control."
"The sounds varied a bit compared to the class example, it was a little more pleasing then hearing just ""yes"" and ""no"" over and over again."
"It was approached in a different way than what the lecture taught, which is always welcome. What the creator could do is to explain the features of the patch so new users don't get lost on it."
It is minimalistic and neat. It feels easy to follow if you know introductory knowledge of Max/MSP.
"I'd say it feels like the ""average"" good key bad key game where you quickly sort through the key choices until you find the right one, guessing roughly where it might be based on the key print feedback. It feels a bit more beautiful than goofy based on the audio feedback. It still leads me to feel mildly amused and more engaged with playing with the audio as it's a bit more appealing."
Code not complicated.
"Feels like the class example, simple to read, and this one has text boxes with directions which make it a bit easier to read."
"Sounds were entertaining, I enjoyed the ""whoosh"" a bit more than the ""yes and no"" shown in the example."
"Coding system similar to that of class example, only difference was the sounds, maybe a few different sounds added in to the mix would have helped."
The feel of this particular patch is very clean cut and to the point. The symmetrical alignment of the objects helps create a simple yet effective vibe.
Both 'yes' and 'no' give a response that I would expect. The 'yes' is positive and the 'no' is negative.
"The patch is laid out well, and looks nice. There are lots of comment boxes and everything is a nice distance away from is each other."
The sounds are movie quotes and take longer amount of time to run than the other sound bits. The meter and levelmeter both light up and provide a visual feedback as well as the sound.
"I think that the patch that you made is really clean, and well organized. I also saw that you have a decibel meter to measure the sound, which is really cool to me."
"I think that the sound that you picked is really funny, so I'm really enjoy using it."
"This patch is neatly arranged. I noticed that in addition to the regular meter, they also had a level meter, which was new."
"I think the sounds used where really unique. I was thoroughly amused by both the Spongbob and Austin Powers soundbites. I seem to enjoy the projects that can make me laugh more than the others, and this one definitely did the trick. The patch was straightforward and easy to use. I found myself searching for the right key even though it was outlined in a comment, just to keep hearing the sounds."
It looks like the patch that was assigned to us!
"The yes sound nice, but the no sound is the sound that most macs make when pressing a wrong key so I was confused for a second. That was clever actually. 
 
 The buttons lit up in different colors, that was a good idea."
"Nothing here really surprised me, I liked the colors on the buttons. And the sound choice made me think I was not even clicked on Max so yeah that was a good idea."
"It looks pretty basic, with some added features like the meter and color feedback from the bangs of incorrect and correct key choices."
"They did more than the minimum for this assignment so kudos for going through the little extra effort to beautify your patch. I learned I could easily have added color to my patch for a slightly more pleasing experience. Also, people will definitely hate my ""wrong"" sound and that's sadistically pleasing."
"Overall, the design was fairly simple with very few alterations to what the instructor created in class."
"The sounds were entertaining to listen to; ""Funk.wav"" was pretty funny to listen to."
The look and feel was simple.
"At first I thought my computer wasn't working because of the generic sound that Mac's usually make when a key doesn't work, but it was actually the ""no"" key."
The approach was pretty straightforward ad followed the in class instructions.
"At a glance the patch looks good, there is plenty of room and space for it to be seen without confusion and it comes with some handy tips and comments on how to get it to work if you do not find the key it has the answer so it does not frustrate you. The overall look is simple yet amazing."
The patch overall worked perfectly and it was amusing and it follows the assignment just right when it comes to requirements and layout. I actually did learn how and where they acquired the sound bar from because i could not find that for my project which i know would have been helpful for those who maybe could not hear it.
The overall feel of the patch is very technical and clean. The patch looks similar to the one done in class and has nice layout.
The sounds are goofy and funny. They make you want to do the patch over and over again because the sounds are entertaining to listen to. It leads a very pleasing and funny experience for the user.
Looks very basic.
It was kinda funny. The militaristic samples rose a chuckle out of me.
They did the basic requirement.
conceptually it was compartmentalized.
there are several ways to code. this student opted to keep things seperate instead of coding together.
"The patch was clean and simple, once again I noticed the extra toggles. There was no media lines used so it felt kind of plain."
"The patch works great, and responds to the keys accurately."
"The sounds are awesome and unique, this is a very well done patch."
"This patch is very simple, and it's easy to understand the signal flow."
"Visually this patch is extremely sharp looking. The cable line that he used to connect the components look like a piece of art work in itself, with a very mechanical feel. The patch looks very straightforward and user friendly, and followed the guidelines of the assignment exactly."
"I thought the user experience was overall very strong with this patch, not only from visual aesthetics, but from the functionality as well. The sounds were entertaining, especially the good key. The sounds were definitely goofy, which make the user interface more fun."
"This patch was techinically very visually creative and functionally as well. I did learn to try to stretch myself creatively in terms of trying to program my patch to have an artistic quality as well, and not just merely connect components for functionality purposes, included stretching creativity in sounds waves as well. I do not really have any recommendations for improvements, I think they did a great job."
"Coding was very similar to class example, easy to follow, and it had quite an entertaining outcome."
I really liked this patch. It was super creative and the sounds were perfect. The good key sound is one that continues on its own for quite some time so its as if it is actually speaking to you and I personally thought it was very funny. This particular patch makes me want to try harder and make more creative and funny sounds.
"The patch followed the guidelines perfectly. This patch did not contain each step by step explanation for each button which I have been used to seeing. However, it works perfectly, it is still easy to navigate and I don't think anything could have been done differently."
The patch looks very simple. Easy to understand what is intended.
"The patch was approached as expected. However, the way that they used musical elements was particularly interesting."
"Looks good, everything all lined up. I like it."
Clean looking patch
"Visually logical and simple, including colored buttons indicating ""correct"" and ""incorrect"" input."
"Nothing about the patch is surprising from a technical perspective, but it works well."
"Nicely laid out, and the two buttons, one for 'yes' and the other for 'no', are color coordinated for the user's convenience. Everything is labelled, and even which key is the 'good one' is spelled out as to leave out the guess work."
"It was a quick experience, but pleasant. The sounds were not obnoxious and nicely leveled. The sounds were traditional positive and negative sounds for guesses, so it wasn't an out of the ordinary experience."
"Technically, it was a simple setup, and nothing too out of the box. Everything worked as it should, and when it should. Nothing exciting, and nothing boring or unusual. As for what could be done better, I got nothing since everything worked and everything was laid out as it should."
"I enjoy the use of different color buttons for notifying when the Good/Bad key is struck. Very simple, easy to navigate."
It feels very simple to use. It's stated exactly what you have to spell out in order to hear both sounds and activate the good/bad key. I enjoy the sounds.
They approached it as we did in class except they added buttons with different colors for visually informing when a good/bad key is struck. I learned that the colors of the buttons can be changed to give a visual representation of when keys are struck.
"I like the concise look and minimal use of space. The author still gives the message, but without a lot of looking around. It feels like the author copied the template, made it more concise, and added their own versions of yes and no."
It is easy to use though I had to do some guessing to find the good key. I enjoyed the futuristic sounding files and it reminded me of space mountain. It would be well used with some kind of space ship cockpit.
I think they completed the assignment as asked without adding a lot. The buttons are a nice addition to see which side your typing is going through. It adds a good visual cue in addition to the audio output.
"This one was actually a lot of fun! I loved how the good key's sound started off the same as the bad key's. I can definitely see someone just pressing the keys one after another and completely missing the sound, which is amusing to imagine. The sounds overall reminded me of the inside of a sci-fi movie spaceship."
I think the way they organized the patch was surprising; a lot of people had their patch spread out far apart and made sure the user could separate the different parts easily. This patch sort of bunches everything together giving it a new feel. I don't think there's anything they need to do to improve their assignment.
"The patch itself is pretty good, the sounds are funny and entertaining. Its a decent patcher but I actually did have to hunt down the specific good key which took a little time but then again that is the point of this assignment so all in all its a delightful patcher. The space sounds blew me away."
"Very simple, I like it."
It looks nice and simple. Very small and compact.
This patch was very entertaining. it almost had a soundboard feel and I just wanted to make custom mixes of train sounds.
the patch uses the same formula shown in class but adds more sound and key options.
It looks fairly organized and well constructed. It feels very straightforward and efficient.
"I think it works very well. The sounds are cool and offer a kind of variety, so that was nice. The experience was always unique due to the variations in the sounds which made it that much more entertaining."
again. very simple.
"I liked the music patch of the good key, it went well with the symbol sound of the bad key. There was definitely a reward there for the effort to find the good key."
"The patch looks somewhat like a copy of the patcher example, but with some stuff removed and moved around. It is clean, but does not seem to have a particular orginization attached to it."
The look of the patch is virtually the exact same as our example from class last week.
"The visual appearance is definitely uniform and appealing conceptually by the simplicity of the design. It definitely allow for a user interface that is not intimidating. I really like the sounds in this patch, they are entertaining. The bad key, had the wah, wah, wah zany sound effect, which is definitely a fitting sound for this key. They good key was great, it reminded me of being in an amusement park riding on a roller coaster."
"I think that the patch that you made is really clean, and well organized. I also saw that you have a decibel meter to measure the sound, which is really cool to me."
"I think that the sound that you picked for the wrong key is really funny,and the one that you picked for the right key is really amazing, I was so surprised when I heard it, so I'm really enjoy using it."
"I think you did a good jobs, and also picked a really awesome music. The most impressive thing in your project is a decibel meter to measure the sound."
"I liked the samples used. Trying to remember where the sample for the ""good key"" is from. Sounds familiar."
