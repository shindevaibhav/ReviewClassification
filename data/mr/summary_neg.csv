I think if you expanded on what you wanted your music playing device would do or even look/ sound like it would have stretched your thinking a bit more.
"If I was your partner Id suggest adding visuals to make it more of an installation. I am not much of a sound girl so I would like to come up with some visuals to add to your abstract music piece. Do the different sounds have to by programmed to keys or can we think of a more interesting way to ""play"". Or are the sounds you play the important part of your project? Is it strictly abstract or can there be a way for the user to express themselves having more control???"
"All three of the questions were answered, but, in my opinion, were a little vague. The answers stated pretty much what they wanted to do, but I didn't read very much thought being put into these answers. All questions are answered clearly, just not in a very detailed manner."
"Using the ideas laid out with creating music using RGB values, I think we could make something that also looks at everyday objects and people to create music in an experimental manner."
"On the first and third questions they had a pretty solid idea, but question two they failed to put really any effort or real thought into. The first idea could be fleshed out better in terms of how the physical presentation would look like as well as why their idea is important and what the goal of it is.
 
 
 
 1. A very simple midi keyboard program for a computer.
 
 2. Another ipod? 
 
 3. A program that reads color and turns it into music."
"The first and third ideas seem most plausible. Combining the two, we could make certain noises when different targets are hit. Expanding on just the third idea, we could make a few different environments for the target simulator. Maybe something as simple as the silhouette targets police use in a shooting range, or as complex as a city street/alley/etc."
"The glove project is the most interesting project. It is hard to track person's hand moving, I know. But you can develop the idea further. For example, if you can use the glove to remote manipulate some objects. Or even an idea, but I think the introduction video will be awesome."
"If I were to collaborate with this student, I would try and find a good blend between using the oculus rift and glove ideas, with the robot army idea. They both are necessary for eachother, so I think that makes complete sense."
"Honestly, anything I can think of has already been done. My initial thought was to combine 1 & 3, to make a glove that works like a midi controller. However, that was basically done recently by Imogen Heap. Another idea would be to combine the soldier drone suit and the game controller. Just having a full-body controller for VR systems, but that would take more than a semester."
"The virtual reality glove would require a lot of fine-tuning in order to make it complete, and although I don't have much experience with working on hardware, I would be able to work on the software end of the project. Rather than trying to replicate the exact feelings of the player moving their hand, I would shift towards a more game-oriented end goal by programming the glove to sense the user's reason for using their hand then acting accordingly (for example, a grasping hand motion would be registered as the user trying to grab something, which would then cause the user's avatar in the virtual world to grab something). This is more game-focused than the original idea, though it would be the same project overall."
"The answers displayed here show that a lot of thought was put into these questions. Everything was answered clearly and concisely, with lots of detail and creativity."
"I'd love to work with the arduino live music control. One thing we could add would be programable visuals with the live music, in order to enhance the live experience. This could be with projection mapping, color recognition, or even animations."
"I'd shift this student's third idea away from live concerts and more towards an app that could simulate what an actual concert might be like given some music, wherever they may be. It would consist of the same features and would focus more on the app's software than interacting with music that is currently playing, allowing users to play a song and change various settings to make it sound as if it was being played live. I would feel that it would be more feasible and more about the technical efforts than interacting with musicians themselves."
"Seeing as how this student is very arts based with design, video, and music, I feel we could work well together as I do myself have many artistic qualities (I am also a musician) but I also have some programming experience to work on the more technical level. I think it would be possible to work on some iteration, if not the complete idea, of the third proposed project. We could probably achieve a basic prototype form through the use of Max MSP I would assume. We could blend their experience of live sound and my capacity to finagle Max."
"Rolling with this idea, the student and I could make an app that would allow people to rate and share experiences of certain routes or part of a city for use by cyclists. Users would record their experiences, along with a positive or negative rating, and link them to a certain area on a map of the city. Overall ratings for different areas would show up over time, giving both locals and visitors a map of safe biking routes and notable places to avoid."
"I am a cyclist myself and have designed my own apps on photoshop, so this actually is interesting to me. Maybe in the app include some of the traffic going on in areas and color coding the safety with the roads."
I believe that some solid effort was put into this by the student. The ideas were well thought out and put lots of variables into consideration with cycling. Cycling is a largely used mode of transportation so these ideas will most likely be successful.
"I like the idea of simplifying things like routes and safety in cycling. I think we could think up ways on how we could branch out with these ideas or even conjure up some more,"
If I was your partner I think Id like to focus on researching the ways large cities are doing this. Id like to propose a way to physically make cycling safer threw lights that interact with cars and the roadways. If we could come up with a way to make communication easier for a cyclist while they ride I think that would achieve some part of your goal. If we could update a rider of upcoming dangers as they ride that would be helpful.
"This student definitely went in depth and was really detailed about what they would do in these situations. I honestly believe they could get a lot done in a week from the first question, do something really awesome and a lot of good from the second question, and continue their project on and make it better in the third answer."
"I could definitely collaborate in making a video or board game with them, creating sketches or doing animation, and I think that would be a lot of fun, especially if it is combined with the other two ideas, into an interactive game, maybe for physical therapy or something. I wouldn't be able to do much with the VR part, but I could definitely help with design."
I could help to develop the visual representations for this world the AI will explore or meld with. But that's about all I'd have to offer to this project.
"It might be interesting to do sort of an augmented reality space - a physical landscape used in a ""game"" in which a user completes tasks/challenges with the aid of things like visual displays (a la Google Glass) and actuator gloves."
"I can imagine his/her project would be foundation stone for future project about the NCVR and AI. If he/she meet and collaborate with designers such as a visual, sound, and media installation person, this project would be great interactive gaming system. This project is quite impressive for me."
"I can tell that this student is very passionate about virtual reality, as am I. This NCVR sounds like an excellent idea (albeit a little risky) but it would definitely be the next step in VR. Visuals have been covered by systems such as the Oculus Rift, but that's as far as it goes (to my knowledge)."
"By the look of it, I think we could make a really good VR game together. The ideas and goals are all there, we would just need to work for a long time to reach those goals. Game are a huge part of my life so I could think of lots of ideas on how this project could take off."
I thing a projection based art project would be cool we could make some sort of projection mapping setup that allowed the laser graffiti to be made on a number of different objects.
I think they thought about what they wanted to do. It was what seemed to be as much elaboration as needed for this type of assignment. It seemed like everything was more or less just an idea and there was nothing that had really been thought of.
"I am very interesting in the third idea. I am also like projecting mapping and interactive project. Base on your idea, I would like to do some ""gun"" game. The gun could have the laser in it, so when you ""shoot"" the wall, the wall will has a ""real"" black hole. On the projection mapping wall, we can create some visual effects that has strong connection with the gun."
"I love the idea of cars running on water. The change to the environment it would make would be spectacular. Also, the laser gun and light graffiti both sound really fun and artistic."
"We could probably make (with a bit of programming knowledge) an awesome game where, as it has been said, draw lines with lasers on a giant projected light wall. The fundamentals seem pretty basic for something that could turn out to be really cool."
"They actually seem to emit a sense of having a clear idea on their heads that may just be much easier to describe with pictures rather than words. i can see their vision, but not much of the whole concept yet."
"Okay:
 
 
 
 I picture this proposition of creating some sort of ""photon graffiti"" that would SOMEHOW work by vandalizing anything you want in an extremely removable way. Maybe something that could last for a few hours only or who knows.
 
 
 
 Maybe I am thinking way too outside the box, let's try again:
 
 
 
 A projector that is kept on for scribbling anything on your wall for reminders and what not, using ""light pens"", and not worry about having a corkboard or whiteboard for everything you wanna plan. Go caveman on it and scribble freely in the room without making an actual mess.
 
 
 
 These sci-fi movies sometimes have these fancy holograms to make a visual explanation of their plans and we could develop something similar, except much more versatile and less impossible like holograms that pop out of thin air."
"Although they made attempts and I think their ideas were in the right direction because the person wanted to tackle larger problems; however, they didn't propose workable ideas."
"I would take idea number 2 because at least we both would be interested in some kind of reform in education funding. We could work on an artpiece that would show how our government allocates money. Since we would be tackling politics, having the funds of billions of dollars would allow us to say whatever is necessary, regardless of what corporations/people are offended."
"I mean, they didn't really propose anything for the first idea. Technically, they answered the actual question to the fullest, because it asked ""what could you yourself accomplish in a week?"" They said that with one week to do something, they could get the planning phase done, and start to draw up concepts to actually get a finished product. There was no idea stated. For the second, they gave more of an idea of creating a way to make higher education accessible to all those who wish to further their learning, but beyond that there was nothing. The same goes for the third idea, there was not a specific idea to state, but rather that it would be better to work in a group to get stuff done."
"Literally, it's almost impossible to get something done with this students ideas, because there is nothing to go off of. The only thing to go off of would be that we would be coming together for one cause."
"I do not believe that this student took much time and getting this homework assignment or really tried. There isn't much to be able to think about here, and although buying convertibles for everyone sounds like a good idea, it doesn't have anything to do with our major or creating something from nothing."
There is nothing I can collaborate with another student on because they didn't write enough idea down for something to be created in a partnership.
I feel personally that I could help with the first idea of planning things and putting them into motion. One thing I could do would be possibly build some rough prototypical components of some ideas they have to gauge how it might function in a real life application.
"For your semester project goal, I think you might be onto something. Many freshmen come into college shocked at how different it is in comparison to high school, and thus, take a while to get settled down into their new world. Maybe you could construct a game that helps freshmen college student ""learn the ropes"" if it were to how to survive your college experience. Maybe tailor made to ASU instead of a general college survival guide, you could make games that illustrate how to use Blackboard or Ctitviz, maybe include a 3D map of the school in a racing game that subconsciously teaches you how to get around the school campus."
"In the past I have worked on classical compositions, musicals, and even post production for short films. In this case, I would love to use my skills in sound design, musical composition, and as a musician to integrate sound and audio into the experience of games. I would love to find a way to use sound in a way that it has never been used for in games to create a dynamic interactive experience in games. On a much more simple note, I would also like to create the theme music for this person's games."
As far as the description of the idea goes it does hit some points. I like the idea of the game for fitness. I'm a little confused about it being an video games or an physical game like sports? I like how it would incorporate on the physical aspect of fitness like using gym equipments for the workout. The incentive on accumulating points is also a great idea. I picture this idea as in the Wii Fit game but not augmented reality? An example on this would be helpful for a visual example.
I would like to work on this project because my idea is about fitness as well. If we can incorporate on kind of campaign about well-fitness and create an event or program that utilize this game I believe this project will be incredible project to work on. If people see there are incentives on exercising and also being fit because the ultimate goal is about fitness and seeing that it is fun to work out they would participate on the event/game.
"The ideas here are fairly well-thought-out. None of these ideas are very detailed, but at this point, they have enough information that can see the thought put into the ideas."
"I think I would want to scale down the second idea. Instead of changing the outside of a building, we could make a projection that alters image based on interaction of viewers in front of a sensor such as a kinect."
"There is a coherent project idea in each answer. 
 
 
 
 1. A set of hand painted images than could be formatted into booklets for special occasions. 
 
 
 
 2. An interactive building facade on a skyscraper that changed base don the people in it or by it that highlighted them in some way. 
 
 
 
 3. A business that creates games that are both educational and entertaining."
The three ideas can be combined into one. I am thinking of displaying the wedding book's pictures at the side of the Skyscraper where people passing by can interact with the pictures with their hand movements as though they are playing video games.
"Well working within the education game, you could possible extend the controller of the program into physical space. Using arduino to create physical controllers would be simple and could create a new realm for the game to be played in."
"As I said before, it would be awesome to have a game that allowed the game community and its aspiring developers be the creation factor of the maps, levels, and content. I would love to collaborate and work as the creative/business side of the video game design process. It would be great to work as a team to deliver content to existing games or even new games that promote community driven creation within games. This would give power to the game community, almost like an ultimate sandbox."
"You know what you want to do so the stretching your thinking can be done in the context of your video game. since we are talking about making the world a better place does the game teach the user, inform them, anything other then just entertaining them?"
i could help with what goes on in the game. The story line or goal in the game.
"As the author mentions, he is a game level designer. So I am interesting in his game level design. It would be fun to explore the key of each level in order to reach the next level. But I have no idea about how to do that. Hope to see your game!"
"I think that you have a few good ideas about what you want to do, however I am a little unclear on both of them. 
 
 
 
 1) For the pistol device that you mentioned in idea 2: Why is it a designed to be pistol like? If you are worried about negligent or improper behavior in a community, why would you shape your device to look like a deadly weapon? Additionally, could you elaborate a little more on what you meant by patrol device? What makes it more or less specialized than a smart phone?
 
 
 
 2) For the mobile app: I too find it interesting to manipulate a mobile device to track social and personal habits. What kind of error proofing will you need to do in order to make sure the mobile app doesn't go off during every quiet situation? Also what kind of habits are you specifically attempting to track? The range of personal and social habits is a pretty broad range."
I would choose to help work on their mobile device application. Although I would try to specialize the app in one particular area like sound and the measurement of decibels. From there I could branch out into using gps tracking data in order to link connections between the decibel readings and the location of the device. This could be used to help find good study locations and develop better studying habits.
I think that the student displayed a nicely planned out set of steps that would allow the project to flourished.
"If I was to work with this student, then I would extend the app to maybe act more like a artificial intelligence machine to interact with its users."
"The answer in the first idea is pretty vague. The writer seems more interested in putting down steps for developing an idea rather than actually conceptualizing a project. The second question is more thoroughly thought out and visualized, though there are some privacy and safety questions arising from the idea of a private autonomous, or at least mobile, surveillance system. The third idea is the most feasible, though I would fins it kind of irritating if my phone kept making personal comments about my habits and randomly playing music suddenly when it gets quiet."
I think that the student made some really good suggestions about creating a arduino program that has some sort of interactive aspect.
"If I was to work with this student, then I would suggest that we extend on the idea of making a arduino program that can sense the temperature and gives some sort of results."
"This person gives a pretty clear idea of what he wants to create, but fails to explain the purpose of creating it. What would set it apart? Why make something like this? Sometimes people don't know about a certain movie so how would you then explain your idea to them?
 
 
 
 1. colored light programmed by arduino
 
 2. Virtual Reality gaming
 
 3. Motion Capture rc car"
"I would have this student's knowledge of Arduino assist me in getting together a system that plays a colored light when a person presses a button, but then also takes a picture of that person at that same time; thus creating a ""selfie"" filter that is created instantly like a photobooth. Another use for it is we could do long exposure photos, and the user could press certain lights to light the picture before drawing with their LED."
I like your idea of building a simple arduino program with a simple sensor system to interact with the user.
"If I was to work with this student, then I would recommend that we create a system that tracks hand movements but instead of a RC car or plane, we would use a simple robot."
I think creating a system to track movement and turn that into to controls of an RC device or like a game or somthing would be fun. This has alread been done using the kinect or WII so a new cool way to do it would need to be devised.
"If me and this student were assigned to work on a project I think that both of us would have to come to a compromise since I am not skilled in the area that the student is speaking of doing a project on. I believe that the second idea that the student spoke on is a project that we could actually work on together, and we could also combine aspects of the first and third idea together to make a really cool project."
"It seems that this student detailed how their proposed project for the semester would look in a week, a semester, and in an unspecific amount of time with a billion dollars, rather than proposing three different ideas. The idea seems to be to make hardware, like a robot, that mimics the way the human body looks and works, with the end goal of using it to study the form of the body. The purpose of studying the form is not clear, though with the types of things this student wishes to do, it appears to be useful for general knowledge of the body for anyone that may want to know, whether artistic or health-related."
"This seems rather hardware-focused for the semester, while my skills focus on software. I'd be able to make it into more of an active, functional robot, perhaps as a way to simulate how the human body would move and react to various factors."
"Since it's one idea this is easy! For a semester, to have us actually work on, we would definitely need some scaling back. As far as a sort of machine to measure brain waves, I have no idea how to use it, or where to get one. This poses a big problem for us. As far as something for the heart, this might be a little difficult too. I'm not sure if you want an actual heart sensor, and what you need it for. They do have pulse sensors (http://goo.gl/7kFhfY) that you can use to measure heart rate, and are used by putting the sensor at either your fingertip or your earlobe. The people that created the sensor have a newer version of their product, which may be a better source of a pulse. 
 
 
 
 With all this, I'm not sure what you would want to accomplish. I'm not an expert on psychological aspects, so I'm not sure what would come out of having these strapped to a person, especially just for the heart sensor. You can tell when someone maybe is scared or something, but as far as getting that data and making something out of it, I have no idea. Especially because you want something that helps special needs children get better treatment I guess?"
So the first answer didn't really say anything that this student could accomplish. It was all very vague and I couldn't figure out what the mobilemousecase project was.
If I knew what this student wanted to work on I would be able to gage what we could do together but I'm not sure what their interests are.
"I dont really know what the mobile mouse case is but going to Dubai sounds like fun, I had a blast last time I was there."
The only idea that you had was finishing up the mobile mouse case and it seems like your are really focused on getting this prototype finish I would like to collaborate on this product to get this finish if we had to work together.
I don't know what mobile mouse case is. It sees like you can use your mobile as a mouse. Very interesting. Hope you can do it!
"It sounds as if you have one solid idea. Could you elaborate a little more on it? You call it your mobile mouse case, so what exactly makes it specialized?"
"I'm pretty sure I couldn't contribute very much. By the sound of it, this student has a pretty good grasp on what they plan on doing. However if they were accepting help I might be able to help craft the project. I spent a year in industrial design crafting prototypes and I might be able to lend a hand in the actual making of this product."
I would team up with this person and try to figure out a way to record and add video clips into a short loop composition that could be layered similar to how audio can be recorded and looped. I could just have certain opacities when I record 3-4 different clips and it would create something different and new every time to project.
"Some of the ideas were successful, and some weren't. I think their idea 2 was the strongest."
"I really liked the idea 2. We would definitely have to modify it, but I think that within our own phoenix community there are a lot of dichotomies physical appearances."
"If we were to work in a group, I would try to blend the ideas of a digital physical system, the app, and the internet infrastructure to somehow create some sort of interconnected environment that is connected to all and is controlled by the phone app. This could be used to interact with others within the environment to do whatever the user wants. For example, if someone walks into the environment, I could trigger a device to turn on from my app on the phone."
I don't really feel like this student stretched the thinking on this assignment. The effort was barely made for this assignment.
I don't know what this student wanted to do so I'm not sure how we could collaborate. A game or installation is very vague.
"Maybe you could mix your first and third idea for a mobile application that interacts with your physical installation. People could download the app and answer a few questions (like what did you eat for breakfast?) and when they arrived at the installation you could scan for their device, pull their questionnaire, and projection map objects that correspond to them (like waffles if that's what they had for breakfast). The beauty of it would be that other participants in the installation would not know that you were to the one would had waffles, so it would provide a level of voyeurism to each of the participants allowing them to look into someones life without not who they were looking at."
"If the student goes with creating a game I'd love to do character and concept sketches, storyboards and other visual aspects."
The app is a great idea because as far I know there are none out there for motorcyclist enthusiasts. For the project you could even combine the idea of graphics for motorcycles and use the app to share cool projects that people may be working on or want to collaborate on.
"Combining these ideas is somewhat tricky, since they seem to conflict with one another. On one side, you are trying to persuade people to be more physically active, but on the other side, there seems to be a big interest in motorcycling. If I had to extend on one of your ideas though, I'd maybe incorporate features to your social media app that not only talk about motorcycles, but also inform the public about being more physically active."
"I mentioned designing an Arcology when referencing your second idea (making people more active). Maybe we could work that into your project this semester. Obviously you could not make such a structure in a semester, however maybe you could draw up some blueprints for it. You could design it so that people would not have to use cars to get anywhere with everywhere being accessible by walking or elevators. You could look up how to make a self sufficient Arcology and try to incorporate that into your blueprints, was well as where you would place emergency services, housing, commercial, and schools."
I really do believe that this student made a sincere effort with this assignment and thinking about what they really want to do in these situations. I think that they really dug deep in thinking what they would want to do based off of what they love to do with their hobbies.
"I think that we could really collaborating on something here. For one, I love print design and working in Illustrator to create fun graphics, so I think we would be able to collaborate on motorcycle designs to possibly sell! 
 
 
 
 I also believe we could make an awesome animation for a health PSA, since I would want to do an animation for my answers last week, and they want do get the word out for people to be healthier, we could collaborate and make a really fun animated PSA about it, and with the money given to us, that we would be able to use it for advertising and getting celebrity endorsements."
I believe the student put in a lot of effort but I only seem to see two distinct ideas.
My DC concentration is insound so I would be very interested in finding a way to incorporate his sound project.
"I think that you have some good ideas. I really liked the first idea that you came up with it sounds as if you have put some thought into it. As for your second idea, would it be possible to empower these communities with a simplified version of your plan. When I think of the struggles that these communities have to deal with, my first notion is not that they are in need of jobs. Couldn't you help provide these communities with the means of acquiring power without setting up a full on power plant? Is there a cheaper, more dispensable means of creating a power generating device for these communities? Much like the paper water filter book, could you develop something that could provide usable energy at a low cost?"
"I like your enthusiasm, and I would definitely work on a project with you if you brought this kind of attitude into a group project. I too would choose to work on a project that could extend beyond the classroom into helping the outside world with what I have learned within the DC program. Last year I worked on developing a garden that took care of itself with the help of an arduino. However this proved to be a really difficult project for only one person to work on, and was never completed to it's full potential. Therefore if you happen to stumble across an idea that your really feel passionate about, I would be on board to help make it happen."
"The three ideas were creating a short film that can inspire and also intrigue an audience, help make the world a better/happier place without the use a pharmaceutical drugs, and to learn more of the side of engineering and development. Some of the answers were pretty vague, like what type of film do you think would be inspirational, what type of audience or culture would you like to base it off of or target the film to? What do YOU think can make the world happier? Just try to expand more on these ideas and it would help."
I would like to start with the idea of the short film and trying to make the world a happier place. I feel that an inspirational short film can help the world or a group of people feel happier. What would we base it off of and what target audience would we push it towards?
Didnt go much in depth on any of the ideas. Pretty vague.
Not sure since I cant seem to figure out what the projects are exactly.
"I believe that with the first idea is definitely something that both me and the student could work on. I love films and I love working on films, I think that could definitely be a fun project to work on with someone else, I also believe we could combine elements of the second idea in order to make an inspirational film about how people can be happy and train themselves to think in more positive ways."
"Your film idea is kind of vague. Inspirational can be so many things to so many people, you might want to focus on a specific topic over everything else. For your second idea, a ton of research would need to be made. You said you'd like to make the world happy with out the use of pharmaceutical drugs which makes me think you're also trying to have something that will help fight depression, not just boredom or sadness. A thing to keep in mind is that the brain holds onto more negative thoughts than positive. The third idea almost sounds like you'd like to know more about developing a program? I'm not really sure what you'd want to accomplish, but you should look for a group that is well rounded, and pay attention to your developers."
"I like the idea about making people happy and I know there is someone else who would like to do something similar to that in this class. What I think I would do first with this idea is to set a specific group (like college students around campus) and just go out and start interviewing. If you have a set list of questions its easy to just go up to someone and ask for some input. The good thing about starting on campus is that there are so many students from all different backgrounds, you'll start to get that wide variety of research you're looking for."
"I really would love to go off of the whole making people happy thing, but again, emotions are very subjective. Unless we actually had something that is proven to effectively make different people happy each time they use this product, it wouldn't work well. I mean, we could take a survey of everyone in DC and ask them what they think is funny, or what makes them happy, and you can make a short film on it?"
"So the second idea is definitely not in reach for a semester. You could combine the first and third ideas though. Obviously a short film would have some sort of sound, but maybe you could make a short film documenting how much you learn about music?"
"I think he/she seem like a visual artist and want to make project is related with visual things. However, it was hard to realize and imagine that is actual project that he/she want to make."
"It was little hard to imagine what project would be. However, I agree with a week would be short week to develop a project. Also, some project could not make with unlimited fund and short time. I think you are good visualist and if you collaborate with other designers such as sound, media installation, and animator, it would be great project during this semester. Moreover, you can make plant to connect these three ideas that visual, clean water or self driving system, and music stuff. These are would be great project to interective each system to make human life better."
"My ideas involve 3D animation, and this student's ideas involve filmmaking, humanitarian organization, and music making.
 
 
 
 So a joint project might could take many forms. Humanitarian concerns can be (and are commonly) addressed in both film and music, and animation can go with both. Maybe it is an animated short film (or at least partially animated), or maybe it is an animated music video to a song or series of songs."
The student wrote vaguely about their own motivations and didn't really provide any ideas for a project.
There aren't any proposed ideas to go off of to make into a project
"1) Vague notion of video editing
 
 2) vague notion of humanitarian efforts
 
 3) Vague notion of creating music.
 
 
 
 Basically, it's pretty vague."
Maybe something with iterative video? Take video of people wanting previous participants and do some sort of synthesis using the similarities (or differences).
"To be honest, pretty sure I'm not on this person's level, neither thinking, or actual like tinkering. Obviously you could blend the first and the third projects because you mention an installation, lights, and robotics. I'm not sure how interactive the third idea is, but maybe instead of a camera looking at the hanging LEDs from below, it can look at it from above and have people walk under the lights? This way like if someone is walking and the lights are hanging too low, you can move them up with the pulley system you were mentioning. And use a Kinect to measure distance."
Together we could create some kind of interaction between a physical and digital system.
"The third idea has a lot to work with, so I would like to extend that into a large art piece that can be placed at a water show or a museum of machines. I think it would be interesting to see the inner working, like cables and light connections, to give the display some flair too."
"Yes, I think they though deeply about what they could and would do."
"I know nothing about music and theater, but maybe with my sculpture skills we could design a set. Although the set would be here in Tempe, it could reference South Korean theater and draw attention to the South Korean theater community both here and abroad."
I have created musical compositions for musicals in the past and I would love to be a part of a team to create new content for musicals. It would also be a privilege to find a way to create a good quality theatre performances in other countries.
"If I were to work with this classmate I would be most interested in working with him to create an infinite theatre. This idea sounded interesting, but I couldnt quite understand the details or picture the end result. I think this project would involve a great deal of technological and artistic components, but I would need to have a better understanding of the project to know what was needed to physically accomplish it."
"All of the ideas have to do with either graphic novels or cartoons, so why not create a connection. Make a book that has the cartoon within it. Create a book, then put a screen within it, and instead of having a regular graphic novel, the cartoon appears."
"Perhaps a more augmented graphic novel, with thick ""pages"" for sensors and actuators, so we could provide sound effects (using tiny speakers) and some motion (motors under paper). Like the pop-up book of the future."
I can see where this student was heading. So there ideas were thoughtful but just not expressed deeply through the assignment but it is obvious they have passion for this project.
Well they appear to be interested in graphics and rich story line. We could certainly make a roleplaying game out of their novel.
"I think he/she seem like a visual artist, especially 3d animator or interactive media. I can imagine this interactive media system relate with human body. I think 3D animation project is so many potential energy in diverse field like he/she is interested in human psychology."
"I can imagine how his/her project would be great if these three ideas will be developed. To make a go of it, I think he/she has to collaborate with kind of artists such as media installation, sound, or performers. These project ideas are impressive for me and it would be very helpful to make human life better if you develop his/her own system in this semester."
I just have NO idea of what this person is saying.
"We could develop some sort of animation together, as I had done a lot of animation work myself."
If me and this student were assigned to collaborate for the semester I think we could make some very cool digital visuals because this student seems to be very experienced in making digital visuals and I am very artistic and creative and I think I could help this student with some great ideas for visuals that he could actually make on the computer.
Didnt go into much depth besides speaking of animation.
3D animation and psychology. Maybe a project that uses animation to help some sort of psychological disorder?
"I think that this student and I could work very well together. My background is in computers and computer programming as well, I think we could take the smaller idea as is and make it into a full blown project."
We could make a videogame.
I honestly don't know what I'd have to offer this student as far as her project goes. She seems to have her concepts and procedures and work steps pretty thoroughly planned out and there's not much of a visually element that would make my drawing skills necessary.
"This student can definitely go different ways into what type of project he or she wants to do. However, I think that maybe he or she should stick to some sort of project that has to do with geometry or coding or both."
"If I was to work with this student, then I would suggest focusing on a geometry oriented project."
"I'm not really sure how I could tie these together honestly. The ideas are very different, but maybe I'm just not thinking outside the box enough. However, I am thinking that maybe you could just smash all the ideas together, creating the installation with the sculpture instead of the light and it allows people to feel what others are feeling. I'm not really sure though."
"I'm not sure exactly what we could work on, but it seems like we both have similar interests based on the responses (Twitch, gaming, time travel) so the ideas would definitely be alike."
I think we could take the last one and turn it into a project this semester. The equipment is already easily available and it wouldn't be much of a stretch to bring this project to life with the correct sensors and programming.
"The last idea seemed the most doable I would try and focus on scope of the project though.
 
 Would it be life size or smaller?
 
 How would it work in a crowded room?
 
 How many reactions would the mermaid have?"
"I would try to help this student get more specific on there goals.
 
 What is the end result?
 
 How would you want people to feel?
 
 What would the sculpture be or do?"
"The ideas here aren't too fleshed out, but you've already begun to think about what things you would want in order to make something. Consider finding the limits of the technology, and go down from there."
"I really like the arduino planting idea. I'm not really sure what I add at this point, but the idea is interesting and could really find a use in different businesses around the world."
I think it would be feasible to build something like an interactive sculpture using sensors and computers to do the calculations and alter the sculpture.
This person made a sincere effort to express their ideas. This persons ideas were about creating clubs and organizations to help teach respect and other important things to our ASU students. These are some awesome ideas but I would try and leave religion out of it.
I am not at all that religious but I would do my best to help set up these clubs and organizations. If they need an app or something I could help out and mix my idea into it but other than that I just don't see us collaborating.
"I honestly don't feel like I know enough about the type of thing being proposed, so I have no idea how I would contribute. Although I do think 2 & 3 are worthy of the time and effort."
The ideas are great. The steps of making a one-week project are organized. But they are too general so I can't develop more ideas base on that.
"This student has some great ideas, especially the studio idea. I would use my skills in web-development and programming to help out in any way I could to get a studio going."
"There is a lot of excess verbiage; it sounds like an ad for Pottermore. Your description needs to show more objectiveness, like someone just talking about it not someone excitedly looking forward to it."
"This entry is direct and to the point meeting the need of immediate satisfaction that this world now craves.
 
 It meets the challenge by explaining the site in a clear fashion without emotion yet allows the excitement of the fan world to glimpse through the basic unemotional descriptions."
"Is Pottermore a game or does it interact with the books? In your description, it almost sounds like a game based on a book, and I am not sure that fits the criteria."
"You have a lot of examples in your entry. If you remove those and just show a variety of blogs types, styles and topics and maybe a blog 101 that would work better."
"Describing the lenticular printing process earlier in the summary might be helpful to the reader, allowing us to get a better mental image of what is being described without resorting Google to get a quick and dirty definition."
"I'm looking forward to seeing what kind of image you use for this post. Perhaps adding a link to the different types of posts you described (photo-centric, media, text, etc) to give the reader the chance to see how the site works would be helpful?"
"Repetition of ""lore"" in the summary. Consider using synonyms in the other places this word was used? Extra word in first sentence of section 3: ""While Pottermore is limited to <b>to</b> Harry Potter"". Awkward phrasing: ""or eventual silver screen"". Consider revising wording and encasing this section in parenthetical?"
"Consider adding html links to research citations and the 99% Invisible podcast. This line confused me: ""Pew Research reports that in the past 30 years the levels of individuals over the age of 18 who do not has doubled."" What are these people not doing? Consider revising wording to make this reference clear."
Completed assignment on time.
"The description falls short, not just in word count, but in its aim to make me want to go out and read this book immediately. Vegan or not, the book should make me want to see what makes it different, how it can be a ""future"" book. I think with a little more explanation, this description could stand out more. Figure out exactly what makes Emily special to the vegan cookbook world. How is she innovative? If it's not just a cookbook, explain why."
"This is highly imaginative and definitely something that would be a fun, interactive experience for any reader. It meets the challenge by turning a book into a video game, something that is surely being worked on by the creators of e-books and web-books."
"Perhaps in the future factor section, the author could make a solid case for why exactly I should go out and buy it. While obviously I'm interested, what specifically makes this book extra appealing, and why?"
"The book promoted truly does break down barriers of storytelling, as the author states. It is a wonderful example of the future book, and giving many examples of its strengths makes the entry very convincing. Additionally, the author's telling is both engaging and compelling."
"Perhaps add more written examples in the middle section, creating an overall convincing entry."
"The problem I see with tumblr is that there is no citation, and it is very easy to 'steal' one's work. In the tumblr guidelines, it explicitly states that all content you post is liable to be viewed and re-used by other people. This means someone can re-blog a story or poem you write, and totally trash it, or even edit it themselves. While this is wrong and most individuals wouldn't do this, there is nothing in the tumblr guidelines stating that this is wrong, and tumblr staff cannot be held responsible for if an OP is not given credit for a 'stolen' picture or post. In the future, do you think that there could be an add-on to tumblr that instates a rule or a policy that enables an original poster to always receive credit for their work? If books are moving to be completely online, would not this be necessary on a site like tumblr, if an author wanted to maintain their credibility and their autonomy as the original writer of a work?
 
 Also, another problem I see is that, while there is SO MUCH creativity possible on tumblr, there is not really a place for those who want to become involved in a story to go. If I wanted to read an entire, thousand page book, or even a book series, I would not go on tumblr to do it. It just isn't possible to read so much information on a post. In addition, an author cannot make any profit, or gain any credit other than recognition from writing a book - so if tumblr were to be the future of books, there would be no way for a writer to make a living. Do you think that, in the future, it would be again possible to add on to the site a place for writers of long novels / book series? In this add-on, could it be included that one would have to purchase the author's work before being able to view it and reblog it? This way they are still following the 'tumblr way' and re-blogging work, but they are also honoring an author's time and energy, and cannot simply view it / re-blog without giving at least some form of tribute. This would also make it a lot less possible for someone to 'edit' or 'remove' the OP's part in the post, and it would also still allow for a re-blogger to leave commentary - just, the work wouldn't be free, as books are not free. 
 
 Just a thought! I think the idea of tumblr being the future of books is genius!"
"The article is well-written and accurately describes the subject matter and how it can be seen in the future of the book, particularly in the realm of fan-author interactions."
"The links are very helpful for anyone who isn't immediately familiar with the app, and the Future Factor of the material is stated very clearly."
"While the links are certainly very helpful, the ""Description"" segment of the article seems to rely on them too much instead of making its own unique statement about what the app is and why the audience should be interested."
"The image provided doesn't seem to reflect the interactive nature of the website. Perhaps a screenshot of one of the activities described in the ""Description"" would be better?"
"It's a bit nitpicky, but ""I have selected"" is hardly necessary here. It would far more effectively to cut that out and stick with the basic summary of the work."
"This is a very good example of a current technology that is moving us closer to a time when written information is created, edited, refined, developed, critiqued, and stored in an Internet-based, 'cloud-like' environment. In a direction divergent from social-networking websites such as Facebook -- and as the author of this entry has explained -- Tumblr demonstrates one of the ways in which our book and information technology is changing from one based on printed materials to one based in a digital universe. Human interactions here are and will rely on man-machine interfaces that may eventually eliminate the need for printed copies of nearly everything. This example also welcomes wild speculation about the way humans will be exchanging information in the future!"
"Since a good example has been found that demonstrates a current trend in the timeline of 'book technology' (past, present, and future), In working toward a final draft, the author should not forget to provide a back drop to Tumblr, perhaps by describing more about what lead to Yahoo's acquisition of this technology, provide some more details about Tumbler itself (images, descriptions), and to speculate on where this technology could be leading us and how it will impact the continuing evolution of the book. References to course readings would also be a plus, if applicable."
"Kali's obvious skill at presenting ideas and information -- as her adeptness in articulating opinions in our discussion posts has already been demonstrated -- will be an advantage as she further develops the idea she has proposed in this first draft of her field guide. Hopefully, she will also include some thoughts on how the techniques used by Pessl in ""Night Film"" will evolve as the technologies for interacting with data and ideas (particularly 3-dimensional) progress to the point in which readers feel more like travelers through a parallel universe -- feeling the same sensations experienced by characters in the story -- than outsiders looking in."
"In the future factor section, the field guide slips away from the pragmatic approach taken in the description and delves into an area of more idealizing than explaining this thing in the desired technical manner."
"Though Unbound, the crowdsourcing platform for book publishing is really the futuristic aspect of the guide we only hear about it once we get to the last section. Instead of describing News from Gardenia so thoroughly we should be getting a description of how Unbound will change the future of text."
I would really think of new ways in which ebooks can change like the way the one described in the field guide did. Instead of assuming that mainly a transition from paper to electronic format is all that will happen. Fill your future factor section with more of what you think is a possibility of the ebook.
The only place I can see that it falls short is that this entry is not actually about a book or something intended to replace a book. It is about a set of applications that essentially act as peripherals to a book. Similar to the way that video game system accessories add capability to the existing system. It would also have been nice to have a some information about the platforms on which these applications are currently available.
"I do not believe this entry falls short. It effectively achieves its goal of describing this ergodic text and what books could look like in the future. I do, however, disagree that this text and those like it show the way forward for the book. I believe they are quite powerful as a novelty, as I believe printed books will become in the future. However, I don't believe they will go further than that and become an industry standard. It would be much more difficult for new authors overall to consistently produce multilayered content as a standard format. It would also get laborious for the reader and the format would no longer be unique. Ergodic literature can range from multilayered storytelling to works of art that use words as their medium. In order to remain as impressive as they are, they rely partially on the fact that the are so different from the traditional book. Additionally, while texts like these seem as though they would have to be produced as a physical book, that is not necessarily true either. A good example would be ""S."", by J.J. Abrams and Doug Dorst, as it is an ergodic text that is also available as an ebook and an audiobook."
"It is not made clear in the description if this resource can be used by someone reading the book for added effect to their reading experience or if it is simply intended that more condensed and interactive ebooks/websites will eventually replace books. I do not agree with the comment about ""the perfect book for the Twitter generation"". Such books and short versions of full-length texts already exist. An old example would be the novelization of the death of Superman and his eventual return. Roger Stern was tasked with novelizing the most popular comic book story arc in the history of the medium, titled ""The Death and Life of Superman"". It was so popular that DC Comics produced a more condensed novelization for younger readers, titled ""Superman: Doomsday and Beyond"" by Louise Simonson. Generally, readers go to books for a greater depth of information and storytelling, which they find immersive. It is usually film adaptations that go the more condensed route. I don't se how such an innovation could actually replace the modern book, until they provide the same level of information and storytelling, as well a similar practicality of use."
"There is no clear connection to the idea that this is an evolution of the book, or something bound to replace the book. It is a website. A very in-depth site with many features, but it is still not a place where on can go and read the seven official Harry Potter texts or an innovation that delivers those stories in another way but in the same depth. It is a great resource for fans, but it is still reliant on the existence of the books, in basically their traditional form, one which to build this universe."
I believe you've made a strong point here about the similarity between documentary and informational text. There is a natural connection in the way that the information is delivered. Video in a how-to or documentary style may very well replace their textbook or informational text counterparts in the future. This is one of the few types of books I believe is on the way out.
"I think the author of this entry effectively argued their point I do not have any criticism, other than that the ""future factor"" section was definitely over 150 characters."
"The only suggestion I would have is to make mention of the millions of different types of podcasts are out there. There is truly a podcast for everybody. This would give readers a reason to seek out podcasts. I know a lot of people who are intimidated by them just because they don't understand what they are, or that there are podcasts out there that cater to their interests."
"I've read and reread this entry trying to find something to suggest an improvement on, and I can't find it. This is a great entry and I think it accomplished everything it was meant to."
"I think this entry could spend a little less time describing less relevant things (i.e., the first paragraph of the second section) and focus instead on simply and succinctly describing some of the features of Ideo. It would be interesting to have a quick summary of the features offered by the Nelson, Coupland, and Alice concepts. This would allow for further exploration of the specific benefits of each feature as they relate to different potential readers."
I think this entry does a great job of answering each of the questions and meeting the requirements of the assignment. I am absolutely inspired as a reader to experience this work for myself.
"The only suggestion I might have is to focus a bit more on what makes this story special and different from anything we've ever read before, rather than on being so descriptive about the characters or parts of the story. I definitely do want to hear a little about the story line, but feel there is a little bit too much of it here. I want to learn about the characters' reasons for doing things by reading the web comic itself, rather than from a summary. But overall I think this entry makes an excellent case for ""Annarasumanara"" as a futuristic book!"
"Wow, this is definitely a double-future dose. Literally future-esque, as in its subject matter, and then the figuratively future-esque of the assignment, with the Unbound Publishing. I'm a big reader and I hadn't heard of Unbound, so very cool!
 
 
 
 I love your description of the book, as you point out right away what makes the subject matter of the book unique--the isn't the same old dystopian novel, but a utopian novel where we aren't all subject to the same old gloom and doom. You point out the book's effects, that it has the ability to inspire people to make a better world, which I think is also important to make people want to run out and grab it. They know what its about, but what is it going to make them feel? So in several ways, you've found a very unique book. 
 
 
 
 I also appreciate that you are concise. In English classes I think we tend towards fancy language without saying a lot, and I think you use direct language here which conveys your message with the clarity the assignment wanted, something I know I had a hard time doing myself."
"Some quick grammar fixes I noticed:
 
 ""two hundred years in the future to a world that is recognizable yet alien""--I don't think this is grammatically wrong, I'm not sure, but I feel like ""two hundred years into a future world that is recognizable yet alien"" might read a bit smoother? Totally up to you, of course, but I just wanted to throw it out there.
 
 ""Truly a novel that inspires the reader to at least acknowledge that sustainability and human equality is possible.""--This sentence doesn't have a subject, I think it might make more sense to say ""Lllewellyn has written a novel that truly inspires the reader to acknowledge that sustainability and human equality is, at the very least, possible,"" or something like that. That authors name has so many L's!
 
 
 
 I don't have too much other constructive feedback, I think your choice of novel and why it is a future book is so right on. I guess maybe your title could be a little more powerful, but that is me straining for some more feedback to give you, to be honest. I think you have room to add some more descriptors in there, which might hook the reader in a bit more and pull them down into your assignment--your summary is so intriguing, but your title doesn't match that. Maybe: ""News from Gardenia by Robert Llewellyn is a utopian science fiction novel created, in part, by its readers.""
 
 
 
 Also, I'm not sure the sentence where you say you feel disloyal saying it isn't from the future is very clear. The whole wording of this part has to be sort of awkward as we're talking about a ""future"" book, and so it is awkward to figure out how to take about that, but you are saying it is from the future, right? So maybe ""This is from the future because"" because you aren't saying it isn't from the future? Does that make sense?"
"I love your concept of the role playing book, and I do agree that this is already happen to an extent. I think it would help if you gave a specific book that this is already happening with, as I believe this was the assignment. 
 
 
 
 So here is where I know this is happening. James Frey's new book, I believe it is called EndGame, will include a mystery with hidden gold (?) I think and an app produced by Google, so people can solve the mystery, plan on the app, and solve the game. Here is a link: http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/comic-con-james-frey-introduce-719685
 
 
 
 Google Niantic labs makes Ingress, an interactive real world game which people have written many books about, where you are battling in the real world for I think access to power points or something?"
"I think you need to pick a single specific book or other media source in existence today (game, choose your own adventure book) and describe that. I'm sure there is something out there that fits your description.
 
 
 
 You mention Phantasy Star in your summary, so if you choose to focus on that, I think your title should explain Phantasy Star, your description should explain Phantasy Star, etc.
 
 
 
 I gave examples of the Role Playing Book above that I could think of off the top of my head but the book that has always reminded me of a Choose Your Own Adventure Novel is Italo Calvino's If on a winter's nite a traveler... so you may also want to check that one out? You don't choose your own path in it, but you, as the reader, are written into the book.
 
 
 
 Also, I think you could compare Choose Your Own Adventure Novels to hyperlinks on the internet. Really, when we browse the internet, we are choosing our own adventure with each click. Instead of flipping to a different page in the book, we are moving to a different web page online. But until you focus on a single item, I don't think this assignment is done correctly."
"Some of the other concepts presented are awesome and future-esque, but this is by far the most intensely future-esque concept presented! Very cool. I'm surprised I haven't heard about this more, as it sounds so revelatory.
 
 
 
 I think each of these concepts sounds so complicated, it might be easier to focus on just Alice at it was the one that caught your attention."
"I was so interested in this that I looked it up online, and it looks like you took some of your info and text ""The team looked at how digital and analog books currently are being read, shared and collected, as well as at trends, business models and consumer behavior within related fields."" straight from their website? Bummer. It is important not to do this, as you will for sure get in trouble for it. If you have any other cut/copied text in there, get it out of there because Prof. Finn said he would run this through plagiarism software and it will catch this.
 
 
 
 What you want to try to do is read the web page, think about the information and process it, but say it in a completely different way. Or if you still want to say it in exactly that way, you need to attribute it to the web page.
 
 
 
 I think this is a lot to write about, as it sounds sort of overwhelming and complicated as three different book-related technologies. To me, it would be more digestible to just approach it from Alice, since you said that was the more interesting one. That way, there may be less pressure to summarize so much of what the company is doing, and it might be easier to just explain the technology of Alice itself?"
"I think what I'm missing here, from the title down, is a clear and brief description of what augmented reality is or how it works. Are there glasses? What makes it different than how I use my iPhone or iPad now? The pictures become 3D when I look at my iPad? I point my iPad at a picture? Where is the picture, what do I point at the iPad, my eyes or the picture? I guess for the non-techie, that aspect lost me. Just a slower, more clear description of the process of reading in this augmented reality. I pick up my iPad, and then what happens? Is there text on the screen, or only pictures? 
 
 
 
 What are QR codes? I would leave that part out, and focus on explaining the process of reading this sort of book like you're talking to someone who only reads hardback novels, and has no idea about the tech world. Just walk them through the experience. I'm a fan of making things really simple.
 
 
 
 And for some reason your title shows up as ""Untitled 341,"" but then you have a subtitle? So I'm not sure what happened there, if that was a glitch in the system or something."
"The entry strengths are good because it explains how The secret lives of Men and Women can attract to people who want rather read from the internet. It challenges the assignment because it provides reasoning on why this would be the future book, such as how people adapt to social media and how this future book can relate to it."
"I think that the entry fell short on providing more reasoning as to why it will be a future book, and I would suggest to explain more about it."
The entry strengths are the detail explanation about the book. It meets the challenge of the assignment because it discuss and explains how this book can be a future book.
"I think that the entry falls short in the reader not understanding the reason this book can be the future book, It give the reader many explanation about but not very well convincing. I think that it needs to be more convincing as to why this can be a future cook."
I think that this entry had good supporting information as to why it can be a future book. I think that the reader was convinced and maybe provide more information in proving the point of why it is the future book.
I really think this post was good because it provided the book information in details and that it was an ebook. It met the challenge of the assignment because their was enough information to convince the reader about the future book and why it could be.
"I think that the entry did not fall short and that its was well written with enough information for the reader to be convince. The only feedback would be about the font, It was not the regular font which is New Times Roman, that should be changed."
"My only critique is a grammatical one. In the description when you saidA animated and interactive telling of the books, a should be an. 
 
 Thats it :) great job!"
"Um...well...I really don't have much. What can I say, you did a great job. I guess you could give us a quick line describing what the story is about. I think that could make your description stronger."
"I thought the field draft was well written, however in terms of the book's future factor I would like to know more about why other books would follow suit. It is clearly stated what makes the book different now, but what makes it special enough to be the future for other books?"
I think the references to Nelson and Coupland were unnecessary. I think Alice covered all your bases on this assignment.
"But will the blog replace the book? I see them co-existing as they do presently, but unless blogs progress in some way, I am not seeing the ""future book"" part."
Description was strong. Many good points and examples. I listen to podcasts often while working myself.
"Future factor was weak. Reference to Konstantinou seemed only tangentially related. You seems do be saying podcasts are the future because publishing might be shut down...? Are you saying in the future, there will be no blogs? If there is no internet, how are the podcasts disseminated? I'm sorry, I was confused by this."
"Future Factor was strong, but it did not match Summary and Description. Future Factor section had a great idea for future book format and good points about how fast technology is moving."
"I really enjoyed this entry's selection for the assignment. It was innovative and interesting. The author takes a unique perspective by examining the children's book. As children thrive on constant stimulation, electronic devices are great for kids."
"The summary of the book could be a little more specific. What formats are you talking about? The description section, while it is well-written, seems out of place for this assignment. The only futuristic thing about this book seems to be the plot line, until it is explained that it is a crowdsourced book. The author could speak a lot more to the futuristic elements of that, as oppose to a summary of the book."
"This entry could do more to find the futuristic nature of the book. Specifically, the line, ""This additional element of art makes the book futuristic as well,"" doesn't really make sense because art has been incorporated in books for thousands of years. What/how will we be living that makes this book so applicable to the future?"
"There are quite a few editing errors that need to be made throughout the draft. A close reading should catch them. Otherwise, this site sounds like an interesting website for those interested in the Harry Potter series."
There really isn't much to critique in the negative of this entry.
This entry doesn't describe an actual book. It merely covers the idea of what a successful future book would look like. The assignment was to find a book that speaks towards the future and describe it's merits as a future book. This entry doesn't do this at all.
The problem that had me questioning whether it would work as an entry was the fact that two of the three products were things that surrounded and enhanced the use of a book or ebook. I might focus on the last company(?) that actually altered the way we would read books.
The formatting is a little bit confusing. I could not tell if there were parts that were quotes from the actual links provided.
There are a few grammatical errors in the entry that caused me to have to reread the sentence.
"This entry falls short in two ways. First is a summary and description. I was confused for almost all the post as to what reddit is. Even once I followed the link, I was unsure as to what exactly its function is. There needs to be a more concise explanation as to what it is.
 
 The second way is in its contempt of the book. There are people who will more than likely be offended by how callously the author has decided to write of the importance of books. Maybe by explaining why they think reddit will replace physical books and bookstores, the reader will have better insight as to why the thought is replacement versus growing alongside them."
This entry falls a bit short in the summary section. I think it might be the grammar in the first sentence that throws me a bit off as to what the actual product is. This is better described in the second section and there is a moment where the concept is clarified in my mind as a reader.
"I would have been interested to read an entry about something other than the style of books that we've already been reading in class, which is what I felt this entry felt like. I don't really have anything else to suggest, I think this article was done really well and its the best one that I reviewed!"
"This entry meets the challenge of the assignment because I believe that it is a representation of a future book, albeit for personal reasons only."
"This entry is not for something that I think everyone can relate to, nor is it something that I think everyone would be interested. I do believe that this is an example of a future book, but I think this entry falls short in every other aspect. I appreciate the fact that this is a more personal example, but I don't think it fits the assignment.
 
 
 
 I think that this can be improved by choosing a topic that everyone can relate to. This is a narrow topic of an example of a future book for one individual, but not for everyone. In this scenario I'm still seeing people having to go out and buy books instead of having easier access to them like ebooks."
"I think that the author of this entry was feeling very strong about the book that s/he chose. This allowed for a more passionate feeling about the book which makes the reader of this entry want to read the book and to see the accompanying film and apps! I think its really cool that this book has other platforms that go along with it aside from just different pictures like we saw in ""A Dodo at Oxford"". This ties the book to more recent modes of media which I found very interesting."
"If anything, I felt like this could have used more detail in order to make it a little bit longer. The length and the voice of the entry didn't seem to go hand in hand. I felt the passion that was coming through in the writing, but then it ended before I wanted to."
I think the subject of this entry is very interesting and is something that I would enjoy taking a look at. Its also a reference to some iconic pop culture which I think will still be relevant in the future. I think this meets the challenge of the assignment because it ties together the past and the future in a way that I think could be relevant for anyone.
"I really wanted to see pictures! I loved the description of the book itself, but I wanted to actually see something instead of just reading about the aesthetics of the book. Also, this definitely needs a more concrete title. The title seems as if this was submitted on accident or out of confusion. Also, please remove ""the subject of this entry"" because that is self-explanatory."
"I think a way to really improve this would be to include videos in this entry. This field guide is an online field guide, so it only makes sense to provide links to videos that would help show how documentaries will be the future of the book. 
 
 
 
 ""Take for example"" in the summary doesn't fit with the rest of the assignment, it is self-explanatory. Also, choose what you want your focus to be on- do you want it on ""Babies"" or on documentaries as a whole? If you choose to focus more on ""Babies"", then include it in your conclusion of how this is a future book. If you choose to focus on documentaries on a whole, then I would omit the reference to ""Babies"" and include clips from different documentaries to prove your point."
"I really enjoyed the description of how Gaiman reads the script of the book. I thought the summary was straight and to the point as it should have been - easy to understand and immediately know what I was going to read about. As someone familiar with Gaiman's style, but who has not listened to this book, the description of his ""acting"" skills piqued my interested in the project and made me go and physically look up the project online after I finished reading the entry, so I feel that that aspect of the description was well done. It was also helpful to find out a bit of the background of the book, which unlike many other stories is very unique. (which was also an aspect of the assignment, just as the voice of the piece and attempting to motivate people to go and read the piece was). I also felt that the last line of the future section was particularly effective and was a lovely way to end the section by tying in themes of the Gaiman's pieces."
"Because the programs are very unique and many readers could be unfamiliar with their concepts I feel that the first two programs, Nelson and Coupland could have benefitted from an expanded description. I understand that the limited word space requires succinct phrasing, and the current descriptions do a fine job of describing the programs actual functions, but specific examples of something a reader could do while using the app (instead of just describing general functions) and how it would benefit the reader might have clarified the apps purpose and place in the future of the book, making the description a bit easier to understand, especially to those who are unfamiliar with the programs."
"I would really have liked to see the author expand the ""asthetics"" portion of the description section. The general descriptions of what users can accomplish on Pottermore is direct and well written, but I think those not familiar with the site would be more intrigued if the author were to mention what the site looks like, how its set up (use of the sorting hat and the house systems with quizzes and games, common rooms to interact with other users in, the easter eggs in the interactive sections of the novels etc). This set-up is part of the large appeal of Pottermore and is crucial to it's success as an interactive site, so I feel that some attention does need to be given to it's physical appearance and practical uses in the description section."
The strength of your rough draft is that you explained the usages of a blog very thoroughly and what a blog encompasses.
"Unless I read the title of your subject, I would not have understood what you were necessarily writing about, I kept waiting to read which particularblog you were discussing, however, you were speaking generally about blogs as a whole. Possibly bring up an example of a blog group that you have found very useful or interesting so that the reader could be directed to those and they could experience what you are describing. You spoke of tragedies, possibly reference where you read about a child drowning or cancer that struck you so interesting that you mentioned it here."
"The weakness of your article would be several grammatical errors, however I understood and followed what you were saying with no problem. I think your article could have had more bearing if you described one particular hybrid book."
"The only thing that I would offer as a grammatical change is to not begin a paragraph with the word ""it"". Everything was wonderful as far else as I could see. The entire assignment flowed very well and was interesting."
"Your strength in your rough draft was that you kept my interest and I desired to look up the site that you cited. Everything flowed very well and I think this is an exciting way to jump off from a book into the technology aspect, as not everyone has a computer, but if they desire to go farther than a book, they have the option to do so. Our discussion boards are very similar, as gaining insight from each other aids in our learning and understanding. You taught me something with this, as I did not know it even existed, my mother still goes to book clubs at the local library, and this would definitely prove more convenient."
"I did not find any weaknesses in your paper, as I stated previously, everything flowed very well and you held my interest."
"The motion does match the description I suppose, although I don't get the sense that the square is walking or running. It honestly just looks like it is tweeking out. The object does change colors though when its speed changes. Aesthetically, I think the program is quite pleasing."
Motion depicts the description ! running period can be increased to make it distinct.the difference between walking and running will be more noticeable apart from color change.
"The description isn't very accurate because it seems that the walker mostly runs at the same speed. I mostly see green squares of where the walker was, but every once and awhile i'll see a red one. The colors don't seem to clearly show a difference in speed for me. The walker seems to mostly be walking the whole time instead of running."
"The description matches the patch exactly. Great job, I like the idea of it being a bird."
"The movement more or less matches the description, although it seems this person is stuck walking in a VERY crowded area. Maybe Time Square."
"Good job. The walker matches the description pretty well. I think it's interesting that the rectangle can only move in four directions rather than diagonally as well. It wasn't noticeable at first, but it's different from the class example. I also like the color changes."
"The description does match the behavior, but I find it hard to see it as a rocket. When the rocket teleports back the bottom and changes color it seems like it is a separate object. If the the rocket were to bounce of the walls I think the piece would make more sense."
"The motion satisfies the purpose of the assignment, though there are no constraints to limit its movement inside the screen."
"It basically does. Though, there's not food. :/
 
 
 
 
 
 Also, I noticed that there was nothing to keep them from going outside of the window."
"Yes, the description matches the animation perfectly."
The animation matches the description and I think the changing colors as the direction changes is also a very nice touch. It matches the behavior in that the walker goes straight then changes direction as it hits a wall.
"The description of the sketch accurately describes the motion of the object. I feel it's ironic though that the Rumba leaves behind a trail of ""paint"" instead of cleaning."
"Yes it does, it walks forward and then bounces off of the walls. I like that you used random with the colors, it makes an interesting design as it builds upon itself."
"I do recognize the rumba motion. It's a little bit too slow for demonstration purposes, but it's pretty accurate. Good job."
The both the creative description and coding description match exactly with what is occurring in this code. It is a fun description and the amount of detail you used in both explanations is very well done.
"Yep. Sometimes the walkers move so fast they are a bit hard to follow, but their behavior matches the description."
The behavior seems to exhibit the described actions just fine.
"The motion does match the description, but the description seems a little vague. It does speed up and slow down like the author describes. The animation is also a bit boring to look at. Don't be afraid to add color."
The patch matches the description very well. Awesome job.
It seems match the description. I can see both the rotation and the moving of the walker. But I'd like to see which kind of character does this walker looks like.
The movement is a cool and funny one and it meets all the requirements.
It sure does match it. The description is pretty clever and fitting to what I saw. Good job!
"I think this patch excellently mimics the description given. Upon reading the description I was a bit skeptical as to whether or not it would look like the motion. But when loading the patch, it fits it very well and is also extremely entertaining to interact with."
"I sort of see it. It's very quick on how it reacted to seeing a celebrity, but it seems calm most of the time. It looks like the walker object continues going in random directions and it doesn't head back to its cosy little area."
This is one of my favorites; it's very different. You did a really good job depicting the fluttering wings and the basic movement of a fly. Good job.
"The motion perfectly matched what was written in the second question. The fly changes states every 2.5 seconds, and it has the four different actions. The only thing is that it wasn't a rectangle, but as the student wrote, the ellipse just looks better."
Yes it does. The fly seems to move in random patterns every few seconds and has several different behaviors.
"The description fits the behavior, for the most part; it does resemble lighting in slow motion. Though, it does not really look like it was changing color on my screen."
The sketch exhibits the described behavior very well.
Yes. The motion described is performed by the rectangle.
"The actions of the walker are described well, my only suggestion is when the walker goes off screen have it come through the other sider and not towards the middle."
It kind of looks like it. It is just really hard for me to get past that they are just squares(or rectangles). But it does what it was supposed to do.
"I do not believe the motion matches the description. Perhaps the speed needs to be decreased, it is not visible when the rectangle is standing still to save energy - there seems to always be movement. However, I do notice when the rectangle is moved 30 units away from a point."
"Your description of what is occurring is not done in the way that was asked. You did describe it correctly, but just not as a character in a movie. However, the creating of spirals is really cool and entertaining to watch."
"Description and actual sketch look to be matching, but it's not described as if it was a character in a movie.
 
 This is also a really cool design. Great job!"
The crazy colorful motions do match the description you gave for your walkers behavior.
"Yes, it does, I like how you were able to use the millis(), I had a hard time understanding how to make that work."
"The assignment matches the description, it works well in that the rapid movements are done with larger squares while the smaller circling movements are matched with smaller squares."
"The sketch was quite unexpected. I had expected a large rectangle travelling down the screen and found one that was small and nearly transparent. However, I like how well it matches the actions of a parachute explorer. The response in question 2 matches the behavior of the rectangle as like that of the parachute explorer, giving me a better sense of what is happening on the screen."
Felt like I just had opened a pop up window on the internet inviting me to play a game.
"There is nothing technically wrong with the patch, however, the patch only needs one sound control, you don't need a second exdac object."
"It has a logical flow, but there are two ending speakers that it can lead to. This could have been simplified. There is only one comments, and it is not specific enough if the person is unfamiliar with the program."
It is very simple and not particularly interesting in any way. I am somewhat bored by the simple sounds.
The patch looks very clean and well put together.
"The patch is impressive and works well, I think that they even added in some extra steps along the way that made the patch even a little cooler."
"The patch feels simple and clean, seemingly trying to be easily understood rather than technically efficient."
The patch looks simple and logical.
"The experience is simple and mechanical with little conceptual salience, but there's still a sense of elementary investment in the patch's function. I'm happy when I hear the ""success"" song instead of the ""failure"" song."
"There isn't any major technical innovation here, but everything works fine."
The look of the patch is very organized and easy to understand.
My experience with the patch is that it's very goofy. It was difficult to find the key because it wasn't a letter. So I just pressed every key till I could find it.
Very simple and easy to read vertically from top to bottom. Same as in class.
"The patch looked very nice and professional. It seemed to contain all the correct pieces and buttons so based on appearance, I would give it an A."
The patch was simple and easy to navigate. The sounds are entertaining.
I found the coding to be basically the same as shown in class. The two extra switches I thought maybe could have been removed. The sound was original as well.
"The patch appears to be very nice, and well put together."
The patch works fine and emits both a yes and a no sound.
"This patch is another short and simple patch but i feel like it needs more room to be able to see more clearly, since it is a short assignment it does not hurt to spread them out a bit more."
The program worked perfectly and it was interesting to hear different sounds and nothing repetitive. All they have to do is spread their projects out more in future projects.
This patch was very clean and put together nicely. All components were accurately described and neatly placed.
It's very simple. Text states clearly how to make the patch function and what it will do.
Pretty simple patch. Not complicated to look at.
It was just like the example in class.
"The whole thing was incredibly straightforward. I'd have preferred something a little more out of the box, particularly when we were given some degree of freedom. It works exactly how it was assigned, and I feel it's a little boring."
The look and feel is simple.
"This student approached the assignment seemingly to complete it without adding anything new or special, so there is nothing surprising or exciting. I didn't learn anything, as it wasn't unique compared to what we have done in class. It's hard to say what could have been done better since we haven't learned much in class."
Looks and feels very similar to the patch built in class.
the good key sound is very entertaining.
"Before even using the patch, I could tell that program would run smoothly. It was well laid out and designed, nice and clean."
"Technically, the patch worked perfectly, but there was nothing exciting about it."
it was pretty simple only thing i would have done differently would be shortening the victory sound file
"It's a very simple patch, it's easy to understand the signal flow."
"This patch is very simple and easy to understand, but it isn't very user friendly. Adding a few comments to tell the user to load the sample and turn on the sound, for example, would make the patch easier for the user."
"Surprised to see something so simple, was expecting something a little more elaborate. In general it was aesthetically clean and pleasing."
"I had trouble figuring out what I was supposed to do. The directions were a little too cryptic for me, and while I might just be too new at Max, I feel like the average beginner might have been as confused as I was. The sounds were kind of hard to understand as well. I could barely tell what either of them were saying - if it hadn't been for the note, I don't think I would have made out the ""amen"" correct key sound."
"I think that the sound quality is a little bit poor, so I can hear a lot of noise. The style of the music isn't in my area of interest, but I think it's pretty cool."
simple yet obviously complex
0
they did something nobody else did. a step up from the orig. assignment.
It seems like an advanced form of patch because i did not quite understand how to get it to work. It says that the sound file is amen and in order to play it you have to from a new word from the word amen. It is a bit confusing.
I eventually got it to work after reading the instructions carefully but overall the patch itself looks short at a glance and there is a sub patch that actually does all of the work in it and i think that is pretty fancy.
Pretty simple patch. Not complicated.
"I cant get the sound to load at all. I dont know if the problem is on my end, but the last patch worked for me."
Couldnt get it to work.
"The patch looks well organized in terms of visually clean, the connectivity of the patch is very sharp and visually appealing. The terms associated with the yes, patch are sounds that would be an obvious strong indication of the, positive, ""yes"" or negative ""no""keys. Prior to interacting with the program I couldn't actually see the speaker connected to the rest of the model or the meter."
"The functionality is simple to use, which is great. There was a voice recording of the word hallelujah and a voice recording of word your wrong. Even when I had my volume on high they were still hard to hear, and the word, ""your wrong"" was very hard to make out. I think the simplicity of the words chosen is good because it is obvious as it relates to this project. I feel the user experience would be straight forward in terms of the literal, ""good key/bad key"" assignment."
"Technically the patching looks fine. It looks like the assignment was followed exactly, the only thing I did not see was the meter. I did not see anything out of the norm in terms of a new feature or function that was not assigned. I really do like the visual aesthetics were very appealing. I did not learn anything new from the way the programming was completed. I think would could have possible been improved was just the recording sound of the wave files, they were just really low."
"The patch is clear and easy to use. I like that there is a button that I can press to activate the wav files instead of hunting for thegood Key, or an ascii code map. I like the meter and the level meter attached to the sfplay object, it helps to know that the sound is playing."
"It is cute and funny. I like that the bad key sound is ""aint nobody got time for this"" and that when you find the ""good key"" it rewards you with a strongyea!. The sounds were very fast and clipped very tight. It made it feel abrupt."
The first thing I noticed was there were no comment boxes. The coding was not complicated but instead met the minimum requirement and was straight forward.
"I like the patch, it is clean and simple. I like the color sound meter."
I love the sound. The audio is an actual person talking not just tones.
The overall feeling I got when looking at the patcher was that it was cleanly laid out. My personal preference would be to line up the edges of the bottom boxes with the edges the message patches above. A minor point!!!
I figured out how to open finally!!! Catchy recordings
lThis is the basic minimum nothing was done beyond the tutorial
"It is small and compressed, which I like, but the opening window was very large. It it clean and well placed, easy on the eyes. However, there are no comments, which would make it difficult to follow."
0
"The coding assignment was formatted and completed the same way as it was done in class, but there was an additional sound meter added.
 
 
 
 They could have left comments such as what key number 97 is."
"I think that the patch that you made is clean, and well organized."
"I love the music that you picked. The quality of the sound is pretty good, and the style is really unique, and not clichÃ©. I'm really enjoy playing this interactive."
"I think you did a good jobs, and also picked a really impressive music, however I think that you might be able to try something more advance or more creative."
"Looks like the class example, clean and easy to read. only thing that differs a bit is the volume control."
"Feel very simple to use, the only thing was the volume control has a setting so at first even when I turned the speaker on I couldn't hear it. After a little time I was able to figure it out."
"The sounds varied a bit compared to the class example, it was a little more pleasing then hearing just ""yes"" and ""no"" over and over again."
It felt rather complicated and guideless.
"It felt confusing due to the lack of directions on the sound bar. With that, it lead to the patch being rather complex."
"It was approached in a different way than what the lecture taught, which is always welcome. What the creator could do is to explain the features of the patch so new users don't get lost on it."
"The presentation is very plain, and looks like they didn't customize it. It is kind of symmetrical, but it looks like they finished it and didn't experiment."
The sounds didn't work for me at first and I had to mess with the live.gain~ function before it made any noise. The actual audio clips were nice and soothing.
"They used the live.gain~ operation, which I was unfamiliar with, so it's cool that they tried something different. But it didn't play sound at first which is basically all it needs to do. They are also the first person who didn't have the YES key blatantly showing, so that's great."
It is minimalistic and neat. It feels easy to follow if you know introductory knowledge of Max/MSP.
"I'd say it feels like the ""average"" good key bad key game where you quickly sort through the key choices until you find the right one, guessing roughly where it might be based on the key print feedback. It feels a bit more beautiful than goofy based on the audio feedback. It still leads me to feel mildly amused and more engaged with playing with the audio as it's a bit more appealing."
"This is another bare bones basically and neatly structured patch. If they wanted to do more they could have used background colors, made the key a bit more difficult to find with key combinations, and other slightly more complicated additions to the game."
i couldn't get it to work with keyboard buttons just the on screen buttons but i liked it still and the sounds were simple yet effective
only thing i would change would be to get it to work by pressing keyboard buttons
"It looks like there is no actual selection operator for the good key or bad key. There are comments however but they didn't seem to relate to the content of the patch. My question is: were they trying to use the MATCH object, but didn't use it successfully?"
"Did not work. There was no operator to select a good or bad key. The wav files were pleasant to listen to, a soft ""hello"" and ""goodbye"" with a very nice voice. It made me want to use the patch but I could only press the open operator to make the patch play a sound."
"Not adequate, extra simple patch and concept but it still did not work."
The patch looks well organized though I am not entirely sure the purpose of the boxes that say what is.. and awkward. It is easy to understand the flow of the code.
"I was not able to make any sounds happen, and I did not see a select function used so the program seems to be struggling to complete the required code. It is easy to see where I am typing, however."
"It was fairly straight forward so I did not learn anything new in the coding. I think to do this better the author could have added the select message to operate the program to make sound. I think the clarity was well accomplished, and in the future they can focus on being more technically intense."
Code not complicated.
I could not get the sound to work with the keyboard. Only by pushing the open buttons on the patch. I am not sure if this is a problem on my end though.
Couldn't get it to work properly.
"It looks very basic, much like mine."
I could not get the keys to trigger sounds.
"They did the basic requirement, but I was unable to trigger the actual sounds."
"Feels like the class example, simple to read, and this one has text boxes with directions which make it a bit easier to read."
"Sounds were entertaining, I enjoyed the ""whoosh"" a bit more than the ""yes and no"" shown in the example."
"Coding system similar to that of class example, only difference was the sounds, maybe a few different sounds added in to the mix would have helped."
The patch looks nice but with a few extraneous pieces. Unfortunately there is a note telling me exactly which key is the right one so I didn't have to look for it. It kind of defeats the purpose of this patch.
"The sounds were unimpressive. They are just two random noises. They don't feel ""right"" or ""wrong"". If I didn't know what the patch was supposed to do, I wouldn't even know if I had hit the correct key because the sounds are just random, no good or bad feeling to them."
"Technically, the patch was perfect. Though there was nothing original about it except the sounds, it did what the assignment asked."
The feel of this particular patch is very clean cut and to the point. The symmetrical alignment of the objects helps create a simple yet effective vibe.
"Using the patch, I didn't ever feel like it wasn't working well, however, I was not really engaged. I didn't truly enjoy searching for the ""good key"" because the sound font didn't draw in my interest. This lead to a one-dimensional experience as in, I was just observing the functionality of the patch."
"The coding assignment was very similar to the screencast. The one exception being that they placed buttons before the 'open' messages. For someone who was unfamiliar with Max or any kind of code, I felt it enhanced the patch from a visual aesthetic and also let the user clearly see what the patch was doing. I think that this was where I was forced to wrap my mind around something. Some could argue that the buttons are unnecessary and it might have a pure simplicity without them."
"It looks and feels a bit complicated, as if there is too much going on the screen at once."
Both 'yes' and 'no' give a response that I would expect. The 'yes' is positive and the 'no' is negative.
"The student added in an extra tool for showing the audio level, yet besides that, there is nothing surprising or exciting. It seems that they tried to add more to it, even with the little we have learned in class. It's hard to say what could have been done better."
"The patch is laid out well, and looks nice. There are lots of comment boxes and everything is a nice distance away from is each other."
The sounds are movie quotes and take longer amount of time to run than the other sound bits. The meter and levelmeter both light up and provide a visual feedback as well as the sound.
"I really like how things are laid out in this patch, it is pleasant to look at. They did show the winning key however, which doesn't make the game much 'fun'. There are some added functions like the meters which give the patch more personality."
"I think that the patch that you made is really clean, and well organized. I also saw that you have a decibel meter to measure the sound, which is really cool to me."
"I think that the sound that you picked is really funny, so I'm really enjoy using it."
"I think you did a good jobs, and also picked a really funny music. The most impressive thing in your project is a decibel meter to measure the sound, however I think that you might be able to do something more creative."
"This patch is neatly arranged. I noticed that in addition to the regular meter, they also had a level meter, which was new."
"I think the sounds used where really unique. I was thoroughly amused by both the Spongbob and Austin Powers soundbites. I seem to enjoy the projects that can make me laugh more than the others, and this one definitely did the trick. The patch was straightforward and easy to use. I found myself searching for the right key even though it was outlined in a comment, just to keep hearing the sounds."
"Aside from the sounds and extra meter, I'd say this patch was pretty run of the mill. I didn't really see a use for the extra meter, but it did add a little extra visual component to the project. One thing I think could be improved is that there was a little extra length of ""noise"" at the end of the yes soundbite and that probably could have been trimmed off."
It looks like the patch that was assigned to us!
"The yes sound nice, but the no sound is the sound that most macs make when pressing a wrong key so I was confused for a second. That was clever actually. 
 
 The buttons lit up in different colors, that was a good idea."
"Nothing here really surprised me, I liked the colors on the buttons. And the sound choice made me think I was not even clicked on Max so yeah that was a good idea."
"It looks pretty basic, with some added features like the meter and color feedback from the bangs of incorrect and correct key choices."
"It's amusing that they used the traditional mac error sound and the other sound for the correct key press was generally pleasing. It feels pretty easy to use, mildly aesthetically and audibly pleasing and neatly organized. It gives a pretty good experience, but this game gets old pretty quickly after you've played it a handful of times."
"They did more than the minimum for this assignment so kudos for going through the little extra effort to beautify your patch. I learned I could easily have added color to my patch for a slightly more pleasing experience. Also, people will definitely hate my ""wrong"" sound and that's sadistically pleasing."
"The sounds were entertaining to listen to; ""Funk.wav"" was pretty funny to listen to."
Nothing very exciting or surprising was noticed in this project since all elements of the assignment were similar to the instructor's design.
The look and feel was simple.
"At first I thought my computer wasn't working because of the generic sound that Mac's usually make when a key doesn't work, but it was actually the ""no"" key."
"The patch was simple, one ""yes"" key."
Looks like it could be tighter/organized slightly more.
At the moment I cannot hear the sound files of any of the programs because I am not on a Mac I think. Patch appears to be working correctly based on the buttons lighting up.
The approach was pretty straightforward ad followed the in class instructions.
"At a glance the patch looks good, there is plenty of room and space for it to be seen without confusion and it comes with some handy tips and comments on how to get it to work if you do not find the key it has the answer so it does not frustrate you. The overall look is simple yet amazing."
One of the sounds was funny it made me chuckle but the no sound was a simple no which i would of preferred it to make another sound other than the obvious no or incorrect try again.
The patch overall worked perfectly and it was amusing and it follows the assignment just right when it comes to requirements and layout. I actually did learn how and where they acquired the sound bar from because i could not find that for my project which i know would have been helpful for those who maybe could not hear it.
The overall feel of the patch is very technical and clean. The patch looks similar to the one done in class and has nice layout.
The sounds are goofy and funny. They make you want to do the patch over and over again because the sounds are entertaining to listen to. It leads a very pleasing and funny experience for the user.
They approached the coding assignment very typically. The patch looks similar to the tutorial done in class. They added the meter for extra flare. I did learn that I should have used more comments in my own patch since it can be very confusing without them.
Looks very basic.
It was kinda funny. The militaristic samples rose a chuckle out of me.
They did the basic requirement.
conceptually it was compartmentalized.
there are several ways to code. this student opted to keep things seperate instead of coding together.
goofy. the sounds used are goofy.
"abrupt. Others took time to make the code elegant, long, or truncated, but you could see the connections. Inputs & outputs. None are seen here."
"The patch was clean and simple, once again I noticed the extra toggles. There was no media lines used so it felt kind of plain."
The patch didn't feature a comment telling me which key was the right key. I was forced to push buttons in an attempt to find the right one and the no sound became annoying. I didn't really enjoy the search because of the no sound.
"Small boxes in general, somewhat squishy and close but it does not take away from the performance of the patch. Same like the one in class."
"Seriously kind of aggrivated. I understand why the coding was so squished now, because the key to activate it was control and the v key. And no, I did not figure it out on my own, I looked it up because I was so annoyed I kept hearing high ho silver awaaaay. When I finally heard the correct sound I was a bit confused, but I guess it makes sense it was talking about teeth and having silver plates on them or else it could cause gingivitis? I don't know, didn't understand that joke.."
"Since it was condensed in size, it definitely took more time to find the right key(S), PLURAL. It was definitely surprising because I literally went down the rows of keys trying to match the numbers. I learned that to be sneaky and troll people, don't show all the connections so that people can get frustrated and slam their keyboard...no I didn't do that.."
"I would have liked more notes and the whole thing just seemed a little crammed together. There's space! Use it! There's also a number box with a -127, and I'm not sure why."
"So, the ASCII code for their selected value is 22, but that doesn't actually correspond to a keyboard input, so it didn't actually function in the way I would hope."
"The patch looks very good, and is condensed a lot. But still looks like it took some technical abilities to make."
"The patch works great, and responds to the keys accurately."
"The sounds are awesome and unique, this is a very well done patch."
"This patch is very simple, and it's easy to understand the signal flow."
"Firstly, the sounds are fantastic. The creator expertly utilizes the concept of ""cuteness"". Even though the patch is very simple, the fact that it makes ""human"" sounds gives it an air of humanity."
"The patch is very simple, but the creator could have added a few things to make it easier to the user. Firstly, comments that tell the user to turn on the sound, for example, would make is user friendly. Secondly, adding a few features like the ability to pick the ""success"" key would be a great feature for this patch."
"Looks similar to class example but minus the ""numbers"" box to see exactly what number this was, this made it a bit tougher."
"The sound was sort of boring at first...but then I found the ""yes"" button and it made me laugh for quite a while, good use of the file."
"Coding was very similar to class example, easy to follow, and it had quite an entertaining outcome."
Simple and not as developed as it could have been. On a positive note it was not intimidating.
"Basic concept, kind of monotonous and it took me while to find the 'yes' key! The redeeming factor was the 'yes' sound was crazy and strange and interesting which made it worth the wait."
Nothing new from what we did in class and they layout could have been a little tidier. May have been cool to add some graphics? A good reminder that we need to push our creativity if we want to come up with something truly original!
The patch looks very simple. Easy to understand what is intended.
"The patch was approached as expected. However, the way that they used musical elements was particularly interesting."
Doesn't look like its going to work.
Couldn't get the code to work. I'm not sure if this is a problem on my end.
Couldn't get it to work.
"Looks good, everything all lined up. I like it."
I could not get your keys to open and play. When I unlocked it to check if they were linked to a file by double clicking on it nothing happened.
"Right off the bat, I noticed that there would be more than two sounds that could possibly be played, and probably some at the same time. No descriptions to how the sounds can be made by each part, but from looking at it one can guess what's going on with it."
"I honestly could not get it to play anything. I can open each .wav file in the folder to find out what I'm supposed to hear, but I can't replicate that in the patch. There also wasn't a level meter, so I had no idea if sounds were actually playing or not, or if there was a problem on my end with my speakers. I really wanted to know if I could play 'Sweet Home Alabama'."
"There was a really cool and neat idea in the patch that somehow along the way didn't come through. I don't know if something had a wrong path, or something. I did see two message boxes before the speaker, so I don't know if that was the problem or not. The idea was exiting, but sadly I couldn't hear it."
Clean looking patch
I felt like I was in Vegas for a minute.
"nothing out of the ordinary, just the basic patch from the video."
"Visually logical and simple, including colored buttons indicating ""correct"" and ""incorrect"" input."
This is perhaps the most basic incarnation of this particular assignment. The sounds are predictable and obvious in their connotation.
"Nothing about the patch is surprising from a technical perspective, but it works well."
"Nicely laid out, and the two buttons, one for 'yes' and the other for 'no', are color coordinated for the user's convenience. Everything is labelled, and even which key is the 'good one' is spelled out as to leave out the guess work."
"I enjoy the use of different color buttons for notifying when the Good/Bad key is struck. Very simple, easy to navigate."
It feels very simple to use. It's stated exactly what you have to spell out in order to hear both sounds and activate the good/bad key. I enjoy the sounds.
They approached it as we did in class except they added buttons with different colors for visually informing when a good/bad key is struck. I learned that the colors of the buttons can be changed to give a visual representation of when keys are struck.
It is easy to use though I had to do some guessing to find the good key. I enjoyed the futuristic sounding files and it reminded me of space mountain. It would be well used with some kind of space ship cockpit.
I think they completed the assignment as asked without adding a lot. The buttons are a nice addition to see which side your typing is going through. It adds a good visual cue in addition to the audio output.
"This patcher followed all the right rules and components of this assignment. I still suggest spacing out the buttons/keys to look better and cleaner. In this case, I would also advise on stating which key is the good key for the sake of time for this critique assignment. But it still played the sounds and functioned perfectly."
"Very simple, I like it."
The sounds are entertaining. It's a bit confusing that the sound is used for both good key and bad key. At first it made me think I had pressed both keys or there was an error in the way it was coded. I then realized the same sound is used within the good key sound as the bad key sound. It's very easy to use and navigate.
I wouldn't use sounds that have such similarities unless you are trying to confuse your audience.
It looks nice and simple. Very small and compact.
"The experience was OK. The sounds were fairly interesting although it was a little confusing. For some reason I though the wrong key was the right key, but that just may be how I took the sound effect."
at first glance the patch looked complicated. however the patch notes were helpful.
This patch was very entertaining. it almost had a soundboard feel and I just wanted to make custom mixes of train sounds.
the patch uses the same formula shown in class but adds more sound and key options.
It looks fairly organized and well constructed. It feels very straightforward and efficient.
"I think it works very well. The sounds are cool and offer a kind of variety, so that was nice. The experience was always unique due to the variations in the sounds which made it that much more entertaining."
"I think the patch looks really cool. I learned a few new things like the counter. As I went through it, I thought of ways to make it simpler, but Overall, I think it looks really good. Great Job!"
"The patch was pretty entertaining to work with and would be something fun to use for a kid. Although, when I was working with It I was confused with what keys I was pressing to make the different sounds. The sounds weren't necessarily ""good"" or ""bad"" therefore I think the keys I was pressing should have been more straight forward but they felt random."
"I think you did a very good job technically working on this. Although the code was confusing to me, after I played around with the sounds for a while it was easier to see how it works. You also did a good job explaining the changes that you made, making it easier to understand. After looking at your code and the changes made on it from what we did in class, I learned a few new ways to connect the keys and make it so there is multiple ""good keys"" and ""bad Keys""."
"Kind of confusing. It seems as though Tom tried to create two different Good Key Bad Key patches and put them together to form one. It seems that he experimented and tried to create a more advanced, more complex version of what we made in class."
"I'm still a little unclear about how this patch works. Instead of just one ""Good Key"" there are two different ""Good Keys"" which play two different sound files of trains. The ""Bad Keys"" play the sound of 2 more different trains that alternate back and forth every time you hit a bad key. I find this to be rather confusing because all four of the train sounds are very similar to each other and it's hard to comprehend which keys are ""good"" and which keys are ""bad."" In total there are 5 different sound files present in this patch, which I kind of don't understand. I wasn't able to hear the fifth sound, which apparently was a bell that was also supposed to match with a specific key."
"I appreciate the fact that Tom tried to do something different with his project and expand upon what was taught in class, but I do think he could have organized it better and chosen sounds that aren't extremely similar to each other. There is just a lot going on in this patch and I think it should have been simplified."
I'd like it better if things were more organized. I have to look in many different parts of the display box to see what is what.
They approached it exactly as we did in the classroom. I didn't really learn anything from what they did because it's very similar to mine. I would at least organize the different objects.
Looks very simple and similar to the patch shown in class. does not have any notes.
the experience is very simple but it works.
again. very simple.
Simple to look at. Nothing different or unusual about the patch. Basically what we learned in class. There were no comments on the patch to let me know what the good key was.
"I liked the music patch of the good key, it went well with the symbol sound of the bad key. There was definitely a reward there for the effort to find the good key."
Technically simple. I would have liked an overlap of sound that two speakers would have given the patch. It would have made it more fun to use.
"The patch looks somewhat like a copy of the patcher example, but with some stuff removed and moved around. It is clean, but does not seem to have a particular orginization attached to it."
"It is the most difficult experience I ran in to because I could not find key 110 and the author did not tell me which one it was. Granted, if the purpose of the code was to find the key, then the author completed this marvelously. I was also still able to listen to the sounds, and this helped further the appeal."
"They also seemed to follow the pattern laid out in class, without adding anything additional. This completed the assignment but did not go overboard in any way."
The look of the patch is virtually the exact same as our example from class last week.
"The patch feels identical to the example, as for usage. The sounds for the ""bad"" keys sound like a hi-hat or other cymbal on a drum kit, and the ""good"" key plays a full groove for almost 10 seconds. Overall, it's simple, and does what we wanted it to."
"Like I said before, it is virtually identical to the example from class. I would suggest cleaning up the patch cords and organization of objects a little more."
"I think the coding was approached very well within the constraints of the assignments, meaning there was no other new or different technical components. However, it looks like they really did master the patch that they did complete. The only improvement I could make is to be more aware of the artist element of design within the patch. For example, the cables connecting the components could be connecting in a way to create more of artist representation of the piece."
"I think that the patch that you made is really clean, and well organized. I also saw that you have a decibel meter to measure the sound, which is really cool to me."
"I think that the sound that you picked for the wrong key is really funny,and the one that you picked for the right key is really amazing, I was so surprised when I heard it, so I'm really enjoy using it."
"I think you did a good jobs, and also picked a really awesome music. The most impressive thing in your project is a decibel meter to measure the sound."
Looks very basic.
