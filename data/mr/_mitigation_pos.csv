"If I was your partner Id suggest adding visuals to make it more of an installation. I am not much of a sound girl so I would like to come up with some visuals to add to your abstract music piece. Do the different sounds have to by programmed to keys or can we think of a more interesting way to ""play"". Or are the sounds you play the important part of your project? Is it strictly abstract or can there be a way for the user to express themselves having more control???"
"All three of the questions were answered, but, in my opinion, were a little vague. The answers stated pretty much what they wanted to do, but I didn't read very much thought being put into these answers. All questions are answered clearly, just not in a very detailed manner."
"The ideas feel somewhat proposed as they are, though I'm left with many questions as to how something would be made or how complicated it would be. The first idea talks about skills more than what can be accomplished. It seems that this student is not entirely aware of what they can do with their skillset, specifically due to lack of programming knowledge. The second idea is understandable yet I'm not sure as to how this would take a large amount of money and time. It feels like setting up an incredibly large and intricate information system, then giving that information to the user in a simplified format. The third idea is clear though the student does not write about how something like that is feasible; I feel that it's less of a technical project on the student's end and would mostly require interacting with and convincing the performers and producers at the concert to let them hook up things for the app to work."
"I would say that ideas 2 and 3 are definitely more focused with and objective, however though I am impressed with idea 1, it explains more of what your skills are rather than an actual particular project such as ""make a video that does X"" or ""compose a song around X ideas"". I got confused at the beginning of 1 because you state that you could build a website but then later make note that you do not have much programming experience, so I am assuming this would be done by some other means like a template website designer and not actually using HTML and CSS."
"You have a great goal, to make cycling safer. If only you wrote down a few more ways to achieve this. A way to report dangers threw an app or something is a great idea. It would give cyclist a voice and push the city to make changes. What other ways can this be done?"
"Okay:
 
 
 
 I picture this proposition of creating some sort of ""photon graffiti"" that would SOMEHOW work by vandalizing anything you want in an extremely removable way. Maybe something that could last for a few hours only or who knows.
 
 
 
 Maybe I am thinking way too outside the box, let's try again:
 
 
 
 A projector that is kept on for scribbling anything on your wall for reminders and what not, using ""light pens"", and not worry about having a corkboard or whiteboard for everything you wanna plan. Go caveman on it and scribble freely in the room without making an actual mess.
 
 
 
 These sci-fi movies sometimes have these fancy holograms to make a visual explanation of their plans and we could develop something similar, except much more versatile and less impossible like holograms that pop out of thin air."
As far as the description of the idea goes it does hit some points. I like the idea of the game for fitness. I'm a little confused about it being an video games or an physical game like sports? I like how it would incorporate on the physical aspect of fitness like using gym equipments for the workout. The incentive on accumulating points is also a great idea. I picture this idea as in the Wii Fit game but not augmented reality? An example on this would be helpful for a visual example.
"I think the student has interesting ideas regarding the exploratory questions of this assignment, but needs to be more specific about their ideas in question 2 and 3. How would the display make the skyscraper building ""less standard""? What are the games that can be played outside of the classroom? 
 
 
 
 His/her three ideas are to create a wedding book of painted stock images, an interactive display of digital arts at the side of a skyscraper, and an educational video games based on a business idea."
"You know what you want to do so the stretching your thinking can be done in the context of your video game. since we are talking about making the world a better place does the game teach the user, inform them, anything other then just entertaining them?"
"I think that you have a few good ideas about what you want to do, however I am a little unclear on both of them. 
 
 
 
 1) For the pistol device that you mentioned in idea 2: Why is it a designed to be pistol like? If you are worried about negligent or improper behavior in a community, why would you shape your device to look like a deadly weapon? Additionally, could you elaborate a little more on what you meant by patrol device? What makes it more or less specialized than a smart phone?
 
 
 
 2) For the mobile app: I too find it interesting to manipulate a mobile device to track social and personal habits. What kind of error proofing will you need to do in order to make sure the mobile app doesn't go off during every quiet situation? Also what kind of habits are you specifically attempting to track? The range of personal and social habits is a pretty broad range."
They seemed to make a sincere effort and propose three things. The first being to just simply plan ahead as much as possible. The second was to create a non profit company organization that hires law enforcement that uses patrol devices. The third is to showcase a demo of the idea with a mobile app.
"I think this student really thought through what they could do with the time and resources with a project, and came up with some really interesting ideas."
"I'm not sure if the first one is something I would work on with this student, just because I like to create things that are used and help people. Although it's a cool idea, I'm not sure that music or sounds playing when you open the door or touch the handle are something that I would find interesting enough to help on. 
 
 
 
 However, I would definitely be able to help with the other two ideas. I think the mapping is a great idea, especially in a very cultural way. You would be able to discover things with the mapping that you wouldn't normally be able to unless you took a trip all the way there which takes time and money. 
 
 
 
 I would also be able to work on the last one, also possibly working on a fun animation PSA to spread across the country and the world and hopefully be able to get more individuals involved in saving the Earth's resources."
"Only two ideas were provided, but I did feel the classmate gave adequate descriptions of their ideas. 
 
 
 
 1.A project that involves touch and sound. When individuals touched a door handle, this action would trigger different sounds. 
 
 2.Large scale projection mapping. The project might involve projecting related historical videos on large historical monuments. The point of this project would be to give tourist the opportunity to learn about history when visiting historical sites.
 
 3.Classmate would like to work on a project that helps people."
The projection mapping project is of the most interest to me. I believe this project would be best accomplished by developing a large scale projector. I like the idea of helping to teach the general public about history in a new and exciting way.
"There is definitely some vague writing on the third idea - saying ""I don't know,"" but maybe doing some game - but the other two ideas - interactive touch sensors to trigger sound, and projection mapping onto landmarks - are less vague, but not all that original. There are plenty of videos on YouTube with people projection mapping onto various buildings, and plenty of things (including childrens' toys) use touch sensors to make noises."
"Were I to work with this student, I would prefer to do something with the projection mapping. Obviously in the classroom/showcase setting we wouldn't be able to project onto anything like the great wall, but we could use the same idea on a smaller scale."
"Using their supposed knowledge of Arduino, I would assist them in using the data they proposed in getting through temperature in their first idea in order to create a program that reacts to the temperature of bodies within the area. The more people there are creating more heat in the proposed area (that people would stand in), would affect an animation's speed. The colder it gets and as it is left alone, the animation would slow down as if being frozen in time."
"I think the student made an effort with their ideas, although they could use more information as to what tools they would want to try and use. For example, in his third idea, it is unclear as to what softwares or hardware would be needed in order to control the car or plane.
 
 
 
 Reiteration of ideas:
 
 Idea 1 - Using arduino, make an interactive system with 3 buttons that change colors.
 
 Idea 2 - Submerge a user into a virtual reality world.
 
 Idea 3 - Control RC car or plane with hand movements."
"I had a bit of difficulty understanding the third idea, but overall I felt that Tammy explained her ideas well. 
 
 
 
 1.In a week, Tammy would brainstorm, collect data, create a virtual and a paper prototype, and gather information from users and experts regarding her project. 
 
 2.Tammy would create a therapy program for children with special needs. She would use her resources to hire experts in related fields, and try to create the best program possible. 
 
 3.Tammy would create a mechanism that would record neurological feedback, and heart rate, when a user is exposed to certain stimuli."
"If me and this student were assigned to work on a project I think that both of us would have to come to a compromise since I am not skilled in the area that the student is speaking of doing a project on. I believe that the second idea that the student spoke on is a project that we could actually work on together, and we could also combine aspects of the first and third idea together to make a really cool project."
"It seems that this student detailed how their proposed project for the semester would look in a week, a semester, and in an unspecific amount of time with a billion dollars, rather than proposing three different ideas. The idea seems to be to make hardware, like a robot, that mimics the way the human body looks and works, with the end goal of using it to study the form of the body. The purpose of studying the form is not clear, though with the types of things this student wishes to do, it appears to be useful for general knowledge of the body for anyone that may want to know, whether artistic or health-related."
"This seems rather hardware-focused for the semester, while my skills focus on software. I'd be able to make it into more of an active, functional robot, perhaps as a way to simulate how the human body would move and react to various factors."
"It sounds as if you have one solid idea. Could you elaborate a little more on it? You call it your mobile mouse case, so what exactly makes it specialized?"
"I'm pretty sure I couldn't contribute very much. By the sound of it, this student has a pretty good grasp on what they plan on doing. However if they were accepting help I might be able to help craft the project. I spent a year in industrial design crafting prototypes and I might be able to lend a hand in the actual making of this product."
"Their ideas are far too vague, I can't really start to picture what they had in their mind from this limited explanation. I am not too sure they too this assignment with the utmost sincerity. That being said, the general idea of what they wish to accomplish is quite clear due to its concentration of words. However, many questions about their ideas exist. Why do we need a new internet infrastructure? What type of game/app do you want to develop? What type of installation do you wish to build, and with what tools?
 
 
 
 Their ideas: 
 
 
 
 One Week: A small digital installation that has physical elements to it.
 
 
 
 Unlimited Time and Money: To create a new infrastructure for the internet that allows for everyone to be connected using solar/kinetic power as its power source.
 
 
 
 Realistic Semester: To create an interactive mobile game."
"I think the student put in effort but the ideas are still very vague for idea 2 and 3.
 
 
 
 Idea 1 - The idea mentioned painting the body of his motorcycle.
 
 
 
 Idea 2 - The idea mentioned creating a project that would make people more physically active. How would you go about promoting that? What motive would people have to jog instead of drive somewhere (especially when your destination is very far away)?
 
 
 
 Idea 3 - The idea mentioned creating a social media app for motorcycle riders. Need more information on what this app does, what software/programming language you are using, etc."
"Combining these ideas is somewhat tricky, since they seem to conflict with one another. On one side, you are trying to persuade people to be more physically active, but on the other side, there seems to be a big interest in motorcycling. If I had to extend on one of your ideas though, I'd maybe incorporate features to your social media app that not only talk about motorcycles, but also inform the public about being more physically active."
"I mentioned designing an Arcology when referencing your second idea (making people more active). Maybe we could work that into your project this semester. Obviously you could not make such a structure in a semester, however maybe you could draw up some blueprints for it. You could design it so that people would not have to use cars to get anywhere with everywhere being accessible by walking or elevators. You could look up how to make a self sufficient Arcology and try to incorporate that into your blueprints, was well as where you would place emergency services, housing, commercial, and schools."
"I think that you have some good ideas. I really liked the first idea that you came up with it sounds as if you have put some thought into it. As for your second idea, would it be possible to empower these communities with a simplified version of your plan. When I think of the struggles that these communities have to deal with, my first notion is not that they are in need of jobs. Couldn't you help provide these communities with the means of acquiring power without setting up a full on power plant? Is there a cheaper, more dispensable means of creating a power generating device for these communities? Much like the paper water filter book, could you develop something that could provide usable energy at a low cost?"
"Your film idea is kind of vague. Inspirational can be so many things to so many people, you might want to focus on a specific topic over everything else. For your second idea, a ton of research would need to be made. You said you'd like to make the world happy with out the use of pharmaceutical drugs which makes me think you're also trying to have something that will help fight depression, not just boredom or sadness. A thing to keep in mind is that the brain holds onto more negative thoughts than positive. The third idea almost sounds like you'd like to know more about developing a program? I'm not really sure what you'd want to accomplish, but you should look for a group that is well rounded, and pay attention to your developers."
"I really would love to go off of the whole making people happy thing, but again, emotions are very subjective. Unless we actually had something that is proven to effectively make different people happy each time they use this product, it wouldn't work well. I mean, we could take a survey of everyone in DC and ask them what they think is funny, or what makes them happy, and you can make a short film on it?"
"So the second idea is definitely not in reach for a semester. You could combine the first and third ideas though. Obviously a short film would have some sort of sound, but maybe you could make a short film documenting how much you learn about music?"
"It was little hard to imagine what project would be. However, I agree with a week would be short week to develop a project. Also, some project could not make with unlimited fund and short time. I think you are good visualist and if you collaborate with other designers such as sound, media installation, and animator, it would be great project during this semester. Moreover, you can make plant to connect these three ideas that visual, clean water or self driving system, and music stuff. These are would be great project to interective each system to make human life better."
"The third idea has a lot to work with, so I would like to extend that into a large art piece that can be placed at a water show or a museum of machines. I think it would be interesting to see the inner working, like cables and light connections, to give the display some flair too."
"I know nothing about music and theater, but maybe with my sculpture skills we could design a set. Although the set would be here in Tempe, it could reference South Korean theater and draw attention to the South Korean theater community both here and abroad."
"Perhaps a more augmented graphic novel, with thick ""pages"" for sensors and actuators, so we could provide sound effects (using tiny speakers) and some motion (motors under paper). Like the pop-up book of the future."
3D animation and psychology. Maybe a project that uses animation to help some sort of psychological disorder?
I would collaborate with this student to create real stimulating sound for the virtual world idea. One of the most important parts of our experience and reality is the 5 senses. I would want to make sure the sound design is perfectly matched to how it is in reality.
"I think that this student and I could work very well together. My background is in computers and computer programming as well, I think we could take the smaller idea as is and make it into a full blown project."
"All of your ideas seem to be based around developing some sort of game or program. It isn't that I don't find these ideas interesting, however what other projects might you be open to? For example, with your second idea: Would you take it a step further and utilize the Oculus Rift headset?"
"I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to offer you much assistance with your project. Although I have some experience developing games and programming, I have a very limited knowledge on the subject. However if you needed somebody to help craft something or to help develop character designs, I could be the man for the job."
"I think your anti screen looking project idea is amazing, too often I have caught my younger brother committing this cardinal video game sin. The cube was a great idea, ignoring the top and bottom of the cube you have 4 surfaces and with video games often offering 4 player co-op you can projection map on each of the sides. you can make the cube sort of a furniture piece, coming with chairs (maybe cubes as well), and a way to easily store it+its projectors. I can not help you on the lines of knowing Max, but I think you should think ahead a bit to on how you could market such an awesome device/piece of furniture. The cube look could work as a ""futuristic"" vibe and that alone could be enough to get people interested. You could also make it so that it could be installed in arcades or bars allowing people to play games with friends or strangers."
"You have a good grasp on what you'd like to do. As long as you're comfortable with projection mapping I believe that all of your ideas will work. I'm not exactly sure what you would do with the art gallery, but if you've made some pieces of you're own you could make them pop using the projection. I also like that you're thinking of working with kids. You can do a lot with the idea of making an interactive environment around them, and even make it so that they can visit different places around the world from their own bed. The only thing I'm concerned about with the xbox is the split screen projection mapping. You might have to work with 2 different projectors."
I'd want to work more with your clothing brand idea. If you have some physical objects that people could model you could take video of that and then build a runway like stage to make an infinite runway. Along it you could use projection mapping on some mannequins along the way so that people can look at what you have.
The idea about creating the frame sounds very unique. I would like to see something like that.
"The person has definitely thought about it, and although the second idea doesn't have an exact project, the idea is there. 
 
 The first idea is to make a sculpture. 
 
 The second idea is to somehow create a way to emotionally connect with other people using technology of some sort. 
 
 The third idea is to create an installation that in short, involves a light and it delivers a message about personal serenity."
"I'm not really sure how I could tie these together honestly. The ideas are very different, but maybe I'm just not thinking outside the box enough. However, I am thinking that maybe you could just smash all the ideas together, creating the installation with the sculpture instead of the light and it allows people to feel what others are feeling. I'm not really sure though."
"Time travel has always been an interest of mine. That being said, and Alternate Timeline Transportation Device sounds pretty cool. Paradoxes are no fun, so this seems like a much more safe alternative."
"The interactive system featuring the mermaid and the inverse of Twitch Plays Pokemon seem like two appealing ideas that can be blended. I am thinking that the project could be an installation of tv and projector such that a video game console is hooked up to a tv, which has a projection mapping of a mermaid on the screen. Whatever button a user presses on their console, the button can affect the mermaid's behaviors."
"I think these are some interesting ideas but they are a little over my head.
 
 The first is for some Pokemon game but I'm not too familiar with Pokemon games but i like the idea of projecting older games onto surfaces to give them a new feel.
 
 The second idea is for a alternate timeline which sounds cool but I'm confused how it would be executed.
 
 The last is for an interactive mermaid projection which seems to react to sound and motion."
"The last idea seemed the most doable I would try and focus on scope of the project though.
 
 Would it be life size or smaller?
 
 How would it work in a crowded room?
 
 How many reactions would the mermaid have?"
"The ideas are definitely clear as they are and feel well thought-out. The first idea is a stand to hold various electronic devices and chargers on a stand, specifically next to a bed. The second idea is a low-cost wearable device that generates energy through being outdoors or exercising, potentially solving both energy and health problems through motivating people to exercise to charge their electronic devices. The third idea is a game in which the student does most of the artistic work (art, models, environments, etc), and although the exact design of the game is not clear, it appears the student would prefer to work on a shooter of some sort."
"As a game developer and programmer, I would be able to work with this student to create a game, given their lack of experience in programming. However, 'create a game' is incredibly broad, as games vary greatly based on their genre and theme, so it's difficult to lay out what type of game we would make; I would need to know more about this student's interests and what their goal is for the game."
"You'd like to make a stand to reduce the clutter of electronics. The problem with it is that there is stuff already kind of like that, and organizers already made. If you do make it so that its all contained with in the nightstand it could be really neat and even marketable. 
 
 
 
 For your second idea I think solar energy would be your best bet because I'm not sure of how you could take energy from the body and transfer it into a battery. With this idea, any article of clothing could be used for quick energy which would be pretty neat. The big problem I see is the lack of comfort from the clothing that you might get with attaching batteries and other things. People probably won't want to wear it if it's uncomfortable, especially if its hot. 
 
 
 
 The third Idea seems to be thought out, but I'm not sure what your concept is for the game. If you're good with animation you might be able to make a trailer that would spark interest for programmers. I think the biggest part before moving onto working with the occulus rift is to find that group to make your trailer and create a small part of the game."
"I like the idea of a hat or shirt that gathers electricity and i would want to branch off more on that, more because I'm not really sure about you're game idea, but I'd also like to learn more about it. As for the clothing, I think a big thing is focusing on the overall design of the clothing, to make sure that people would wear them. I also think development of a solar battery would need to go into the shits/hats/pants as well. Things to consider is if they need to be connected to the shirt at all times, how heavy they would be, and if the article are machine washable."
"The student could use more time to get more specific with the ideas.
 
 The first just states what they would work with not exactly what they would make.
 
 The second is for a system that automatically tended to a garden, I was wondering how this would be done.
 
 The last is for an interactive sculpture which seems interesting."
"I would try to help this student get more specific on there goals.
 
 What is the end result?
 
 How would you want people to feel?
 
 What would the sculpture be or do?"
"The ideas here aren't too fleshed out, but you've already begun to think about what things you would want in order to make something. Consider finding the limits of the technology, and go down from there."
"Your idea is very deeply thought out. Religion is an important aspect in an individual's life and it can help one out through college experience. I know the feeling of being wanting to fit into a group or service that you are interested and passion about. Your project seems very interesting, not everyone will agree to religion but they will agree to a community build upon passion"
"The person has definitely thought of what they wanted to do. Although, I'm honestly not sure how exactly it would tie into digital culture. I do see potential in it though. Maybe some more thought about what digital culture is about, then try and make something that ties directly to that idea.
 
 The first idea is to basically make a song for someone.
 
 The second idea is to create an organization kinda like the Newman Center but better.
 
 The third idea is to become more connected with other campuses to create a more equal culture."
"I think that maybe we could tie in the songs with individuals and their need for equality. I guess what I am saying is that we could make an installation that scans someones face, then according to their structure or facial expression, it would create a song for that person."
"I am intrigued by the project on the third bullet, only thing that keeps me wondering how well it would work is just the movement part because part of the illusion of space involvements like this is kinesthesic activity.
 
 
 
 SO!
 
 
 
 Introducing Virtuix Omni: a treadmill specifically designed of VR movement. http://www.virtuix.com/
 
 
 
 Perhaps using this could help with the production, albeit I am not sure if it would work way much better using Oculus Rift as well, which might just ruin the point of creating a projected environment outside.
 
 
 
 But I digress, I can sense something brewing."
"The ideas of a physical object that can be projected on with animations that can cater to the shape, a cloth or outfit that can be tracked and projected onto for plays and musicals, and a Immersive animation sequence that give the persona sense of being in the POV of the character. You did give this sincere effort and I do like the three of your ideas. I actually love the idea of the clothing that can be tracked and projected onto. It sounds extremely difficult but since your given a billion dollars I'm sure you can accomplish it."
I would help this artist to consider the time involved in animating because they would be making two animations which is going to eat up some time especially if they want to work in 3D. I would also hope they had some ideas on what the character looked like or the environment they character would be in because I would want to get started on the animations as soon as possible.
"The student put in effort into their ideas but I think more details are needed, as well as possible tools/skills that would be required. In idea 2, I love the idea, but how would you incorporate the solar energy part with this clean water process? In idea 3, I think more information is needed as to what materials/tools/skills would possibly be required for a group of students to create possible prototypes.
 
 
 
 Reiteration of ideas:
 
 Idea 1 - Creation of the outline, draft, visual presentation, write up, and materials required for a possible project.
 
 Idea 2 - Provide clean water to people, and also an air transport system to collect rain water, purify it, and then distribute it, by using solar energy.
 
 Idea 3 - Create prototypes of idea 2 and distribute it with biodegradable containers."
"Your ideas reminded me of the LifeStraw (http://www.buylifestraw.com/). This technology allows people around the world to filter contaminated water and allow it to be instantly drinkable through a straw. I think in a semester or two, a group of students could take a LifeStraw, and build on it even more somehow. Maybe use the same technology to where, instead of drinking from a straw, make a fast and easy way to clean and store this water instead for later usage."
I very much enjoy the idea of the rain water collecting building. We take for granted of the water supply we get in America even though some part of the country is hurting from trouts and lack of water. For an idea that gather rain water for usage is a pretty good idea. The facility can be build in an area that is rich with rain during certain time of the year like Florida or Washington. If you can collect the water then filter and a way to distribute it it would be really helpful.
"Is Pottermore a game or does it interact with the books? In your description, it almost sounds like a game based on a book, and I am not sure that fits the criteria."
"You have a lot of examples in your entry. If you remove those and just show a variety of blogs types, styles and topics and maybe a blog 101 that would work better."
I wonder if Reddit has everything like you state. How is the information validated? Are there actual books there or is it just blogs and just used for information look up? Your guide is slightly confusing to me if you could clarify I would appreciate it.
"Describing the lenticular printing process earlier in the summary might be helpful to the reader, allowing us to get a better mental image of what is being described without resorting Google to get a quick and dirty definition."
"I'm looking forward to seeing what kind of image you use for this post. Perhaps adding a link to the different types of posts you described (photo-centric, media, text, etc) to give the reader the chance to see how the site works would be helpful?"
"Repetition of ""lore"" in the summary. Consider using synonyms in the other places this word was used? Extra word in first sentence of section 3: ""While Pottermore is limited to <b>to</b> Harry Potter"". Awkward phrasing: ""or eventual silver screen"". Consider revising wording and encasing this section in parenthetical?"
"I encountered several run-on sentences throughout the assignment. This made it difficult to follow the author's arguments. Consider revising and parsing arguments out into a more centralized format. Additionally, incorrect word usage (""is becoming more patience"", ""provides the reader to"", ""as oppose to a book"", etc) made it extremely difficult to assimilate the author's meaning."
"Having no idea what an ""augmented reality reading experience"" is, your summary only confused me! Maybe somehow include in that initial summary that this product's purpose is to deliver a 3D reading and viewing experience. That is the point of this technology, correct?
 
 
 
 Also, the following sentence is confusing: ""At this time, it is an iPhone or iPad but there is an Android version under development."" I ran into many of these ""for instances"" and kept having to reread sections of your assignment. It was choppy to me and a hard read. There are numerous run on sentences and a plethora of facts but not enough explanation.Perhaps my best advice to you, as someone who has never heard of such a technology, is to reread your assignment and pretend you're in my shoes.
 
 
 
 Good luck!"
"The only thing I can say could use a bit of revising would be that you kept repeating that this book is a compilation of many different people's thoughts. I felt while reading your assignment that you may have repeated this so many times in different ways to fill space and hit the required word counts. If this is true, it's unfortunate because you did a great job on this assignment. I'd omit some of these repetitive phrases in your final draft.
 
 
 
 I also noticed the misspelling of a word in the following sentence: ""What makes this book afuture book is that it doesnt have a single author. It is more like an interactive blog or news feed on an internet social media sight ([SITE]<--change to this spelling) that an actual book."""
"I disagree with you that the future of books will be audiobooks! That's besides the point though and a personal opinion, not a literary critique. In all, I think that you completed this assignment in a purposeful, meaningful manner.
 
 
 
 Perhaps the only critique I have is that maybe you could explain why audiobooks haven't already taken off (it's a media that's been around for quite some time) and expand on the idea of why now is the audiobook's perfect opportunity for a comeback."
"UNFORTUNATELY, I don't think that your assignment needs much revision. You did an excellent job of ""doing it right the first time"" and it is obvious that your sentences are thoughtful and calculated.
 
 
 
 If anything, maybe include the pottermore.com link in your summary?
 
 
 
 Great work. I'm looking forward to reading and ""critiquing"" your future assignments for this class!"
"I had a hard time finding the strengths of your assignment, as I don't think that you followed the assignment prompt. After reading and rereading your writing, I'm not clear as to what you think the future book will look like. I understand that you've done some family history research and plan on passing it down to your children and your children's children via digital photography and writing, though I have no idea about what you think the future of books will be.
 
 
 
 Please see my constructive criticism below, as I think that your rough draft needs some major rewriting."
"The description falls short, not just in word count, but in its aim to make me want to go out and read this book immediately. Vegan or not, the book should make me want to see what makes it different, how it can be a ""future"" book. I think with a little more explanation, this description could stand out more. Figure out exactly what makes Emily special to the vegan cookbook world. How is she innovative? If it's not just a cookbook, explain why."
"The future factor explanation is very well done. I definitely want to find something like this, as I'm sure most people who enjoy faster processing would. By appealing to the demand of the people, this entry meets the challenge, though it does not offer a way for people to actually find such a book."
"Perhaps in the future factor section, the author could make a solid case for why exactly I should go out and buy it. While obviously I'm interested, what specifically makes this book extra appealing, and why?"
"The only thing I think may have been too bold of a statement was when you said that ""film will always be more powerful than text"". I do think that this is a rather subjective statement, as many individuals absolutely become enchanted by and involved in a story when it is on page, because so much is left up to their own imagination. The voice and image of a character, the tone or the character's overall mood, the atmosphere of a building or of a place - and the beauty of written text, at least in fictional stories, is that my perception of a character will never match another's; yet, in a film, a character appears in a very straightforward way, with very little interpretation to the viewer. I think it very much depends on the genre, for one to say that film is more powerful than text. Of course, if a demonstration or learning technique needs to be taught, I can definitely see how film is the way to go. But as for me, I have always been more comfortable with text, as it is easy for me to segment, control, and become enveloped in a story. I guess my critique would be to clarify WHEN film is more powerful than text (as you did) instead of making a general statement that film is ALWAYS better, as many people may not feel this is true. But, other then this, I literally thought that what you wrote was perfect, and I think you posed wonderful points and thoughts - great job!"
"The problem I see with tumblr is that there is no citation, and it is very easy to 'steal' one's work. In the tumblr guidelines, it explicitly states that all content you post is liable to be viewed and re-used by other people. This means someone can re-blog a story or poem you write, and totally trash it, or even edit it themselves. While this is wrong and most individuals wouldn't do this, there is nothing in the tumblr guidelines stating that this is wrong, and tumblr staff cannot be held responsible for if an OP is not given credit for a 'stolen' picture or post. In the future, do you think that there could be an add-on to tumblr that instates a rule or a policy that enables an original poster to always receive credit for their work? If books are moving to be completely online, would not this be necessary on a site like tumblr, if an author wanted to maintain their credibility and their autonomy as the original writer of a work?
 
 Also, another problem I see is that, while there is SO MUCH creativity possible on tumblr, there is not really a place for those who want to become involved in a story to go. If I wanted to read an entire, thousand page book, or even a book series, I would not go on tumblr to do it. It just isn't possible to read so much information on a post. In addition, an author cannot make any profit, or gain any credit other than recognition from writing a book - so if tumblr were to be the future of books, there would be no way for a writer to make a living. Do you think that, in the future, it would be again possible to add on to the site a place for writers of long novels / book series? In this add-on, could it be included that one would have to purchase the author's work before being able to view it and reblog it? This way they are still following the 'tumblr way' and re-blogging work, but they are also honoring an author's time and energy, and cannot simply view it / re-blog without giving at least some form of tribute. This would also make it a lot less possible for someone to 'edit' or 'remove' the OP's part in the post, and it would also still allow for a re-blogger to leave commentary - just, the work wouldn't be free, as books are not free. 
 
 Just a thought! I think the idea of tumblr being the future of books is genius!"
"The only issue I see with your future book idea is that, unless actual books / stories are uploaded by Reddit users, one cant really become involved / pulled in to a fictional world or fantasy land. For many, books are a means of escape, and many book readers want to become involved in the lives of the characters, want to understand them and relate to them, fight for them or fight against them; also, many individuals who read also like the idea of an alternate world existing. For instance, I believe that this is why so many series, like Harry Potter, The Hunger Games, or The Lord of the Rings, were so huge  because there was another universe that readers could disappear into. 
 
 Im not saying that there is no possibility for things like this to exist on Reddit  but your post didnt really give the feeling that users post stories full of characters or alternate worlds. I think that, if you were to include that in the future, entire books and stories will be uploaded onto Reddit, that this is the way books may be read in the future. For instance, if you said something akin to the following,instead of authors publishing books through a publishing company, maybe they will publish their novels through websites such as Reddit, as so many individuals use this website, it would give the sense that books in general are moving in the direction of being completely online through such websites."
"I believe that the author should make sure to be more clear about the fact that you can use this book in more ways than just reading through pages. Although e-devices were mentioned, I was still confused as to whether or not this type of book would be hand-held, on an e-device, or both. How will the book be accessed on an e-device - from a website? Will it be purchased and downloaded instantaneously, or ordered? Will it have any software that must be installed onto an e-device? While the author said that this book would be available for e-devices, I feel it should be more explicitly stated that it can fluctuate between being an experience through page or through screen, both, or neither, because I am still unsure as to whether this book can be read in the way a traditional book is read, or if that is not the case at all. Other than this, this genre of future books sounds exciting!"
"For the most part, the article is solid, even if the ""Description"" section is a bit short.
 
 
 
 My only criticism is that the article seems to only give vague examples as the girth of interactive activities that are available on Pottermore. For example, fan fiction--it's described as a hub for it, what does Pottermore offer that other fanfiction hosting websites do not? How is fanfiction integrated with other areas of the website mentioned, if there is any at all? 
 
 
 
 Also, because Pottermore is an online entity, perhaps it would be helpful to include links?"
"While the links are certainly very helpful, the ""Description"" segment of the article seems to rely on them too much instead of making its own unique statement about what the app is and why the audience should be interested."
"The image provided doesn't seem to reflect the interactive nature of the website. Perhaps a screenshot of one of the activities described in the ""Description"" would be better?"
"Describing a specific blog, rather than just describing the medium in general, would probably be a better way of showcasing the nature of the blog. However, if the author chooses to continue with simply talking about blogs in general, linking to specific blogs and blogging platforms would be a good way to showcase the diversity mentioned here, rather than just assuring the audience that it exists."
"This is a reasonable example of the direction in which future books are heading, but as the author continues to develop the field guide, it may be interesting for the reader if some of the history of the comic book, particularly as it developed in Japan (Manga, Anime) and Korea (Manhwa) is provided, as well as some thoughts on where all of this may be going as we proceed through this century and beyond. For example, it would seem that this style of reading entertainment -- especially popular to young adults -- is well suited for eventual transformation into 3-D renderings, perhaps even holographic, at some point in the future. In addition, some reference and relevance to our course readings (if possible) would make for a stronger case in point."
"One area in which this entry may fall short (as is the case with my own entry) is that a specific work is not identified. It may be helpful if an example of something like this could be found and then used as a supporting basis for the remainder of the field guide. The implication that the technology of the book and of information in general is moving toward digital is, I think, a valid one, but I for one would like to learn a little more about the specific portions of DNA components that allow us to be able to track historical genetic data and what this technology could afford us in 50 or 100 years. Also, it's always a good idea (as I'm sure you know) if our academic writing can be supported by relevant citations that support our statements and speculations. As your entry thus far is merely a rough first cut (for all of us), this is probably already in your plans as you work toward a final version!"
"As mentioned in other critiques, and as this idea continues to be refined, some thought should be spent on the possibility of describing the history of book technology and in providing suggestions for where our digital reading technology is taking us. To be sure, printed books have been a critical factor in the advancement of mankind, but I think it would be nice to read more about some of the differences between what some of us may have experienced as children and what amazing options are for the children of today. Extend this into the future, and the possibilities become quite exciting indeed!"
"The field guide attempts to show the ability that technology has to instantly document our lives and save that documentation forever, without fear of it being lost due to some physical destruction. The problem is we spend most of the field guide learning about the authors time his/her brother uploaded their DNA online in order to map back potential members of their gene pool. While this is interesting it seems to fall short of the assigned task of finding a (a real book, object, publication, real or virtual thing), not something made up."
The only place I can see that it falls short is that this entry is not actually about a book or something intended to replace a book. It is about a set of applications that essentially act as peripherals to a book. Similar to the way that video game system accessories add capability to the existing system. It would also have been nice to have a some information about the platforms on which these applications are currently available.
"I think the author of this entry effectively argued their point I do not have any criticism, other than that the ""future factor"" section was definitely over 150 characters."
"The only suggestion I might have is to focus a bit more on what makes this story special and different from anything we've ever read before, rather than on being so descriptive about the characters or parts of the story. I definitely do want to hear a little about the story line, but feel there is a little bit too much of it here. I want to learn about the characters' reasons for doing things by reading the web comic itself, rather than from a summary. But overall I think this entry makes an excellent case for ""Annarasumanara"" as a futuristic book!"
"Some quick grammar edits I noticed:
 
 Film is powerful, and ""showing"" something to a learner is much more relatable that ""explaining"" something to a learner. -- that needs to be than.
 
 Babies cry when their hungry or uncomfortable and are not capable of fending for themselves. --their needs to be they are or they're.
 
 
 
 ""Film will always be more powerful than text."" This is a huge statement, and I don't think this one film or field guide backs up this statement. Your paragraph after this begins to argue that watching something on a page would be somehow better than reading words on a page, but you don't explain why. Probably I got bristled by this just because I'm a huge reader--for me, text will always be more powerful than film. But I think it might be easier to stick to this specific film, and say why this film is more powerful as a movie than it would be in book form. It is so much easier to prove a smaller point than a larger one, and the length limits for this assignment were so limited the space is really restricted to make a larger point.
 
 
 
 Also, I love your idea of a future book, in the third part, but the instructions read to describe what makes this specific item a future book. So again, I would maybe draw back to the movie Babies and talk a bit more about what the future factor of this film is. I think you could even move the last paragraph of your summary down to that third part, and get into a bit more of the movie's documentary aspect in the middle part, an exploration of the documentary as 'book' in the middle section.
 
 
 
 Oh, also I believe you need a pic! Somewhere in there. There were so many amazing shots in that film, I'm sure you can find a great screenshot online. Or, I'm not sure if this is possible with html but I believe it is, I bet you could link the trailer here from Youtube and use that as your pic? That might give readers the best idea of the film."
"Some quick grammar fixes I noticed:
 
 ""two hundred years in the future to a world that is recognizable yet alien""--I don't think this is grammatically wrong, I'm not sure, but I feel like ""two hundred years into a future world that is recognizable yet alien"" might read a bit smoother? Totally up to you, of course, but I just wanted to throw it out there.
 
 ""Truly a novel that inspires the reader to at least acknowledge that sustainability and human equality is possible.""--This sentence doesn't have a subject, I think it might make more sense to say ""Lllewellyn has written a novel that truly inspires the reader to acknowledge that sustainability and human equality is, at the very least, possible,"" or something like that. That authors name has so many L's!
 
 
 
 I don't have too much other constructive feedback, I think your choice of novel and why it is a future book is so right on. I guess maybe your title could be a little more powerful, but that is me straining for some more feedback to give you, to be honest. I think you have room to add some more descriptors in there, which might hook the reader in a bit more and pull them down into your assignment--your summary is so intriguing, but your title doesn't match that. Maybe: ""News from Gardenia by Robert Llewellyn is a utopian science fiction novel created, in part, by its readers.""
 
 
 
 Also, I'm not sure the sentence where you say you feel disloyal saying it isn't from the future is very clear. The whole wording of this part has to be sort of awkward as we're talking about a ""future"" book, and so it is awkward to figure out how to take about that, but you are saying it is from the future, right? So maybe ""This is from the future because"" because you aren't saying it isn't from the future? Does that make sense?"
"I love your concept of the role playing book, and I do agree that this is already happen to an extent. I think it would help if you gave a specific book that this is already happening with, as I believe this was the assignment. 
 
 
 
 So here is where I know this is happening. James Frey's new book, I believe it is called EndGame, will include a mystery with hidden gold (?) I think and an app produced by Google, so people can solve the mystery, plan on the app, and solve the game. Here is a link: http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/comic-con-james-frey-introduce-719685
 
 
 
 Google Niantic labs makes Ingress, an interactive real world game which people have written many books about, where you are battling in the real world for I think access to power points or something?"
"I think what I'm missing here, from the title down, is a clear and brief description of what augmented reality is or how it works. Are there glasses? What makes it different than how I use my iPhone or iPad now? The pictures become 3D when I look at my iPad? I point my iPad at a picture? Where is the picture, what do I point at the iPad, my eyes or the picture? I guess for the non-techie, that aspect lost me. Just a slower, more clear description of the process of reading in this augmented reality. I pick up my iPad, and then what happens? Is there text on the screen, or only pictures? 
 
 
 
 What are QR codes? I would leave that part out, and focus on explaining the process of reading this sort of book like you're talking to someone who only reads hardback novels, and has no idea about the tech world. Just walk them through the experience. I'm a fan of making things really simple.
 
 
 
 And for some reason your title shows up as ""Untitled 341,"" but then you have a subtitle? So I'm not sure what happened there, if that was a glitch in the system or something."
"I think that the entry did not fall short and that its was well written with enough information for the reader to be convince. The only feedback would be about the font, It was not the regular font which is New Times Roman, that should be changed."
"First of all, there are certainly some typographical errors that are easily corrected, such as ""individuals over the age of 18 who do not has doubled."" I assume that is meant to read ""over the age of 18 who do not READ has doubled"". 
 
 I believe that this field guide would also benefit from more focus. Rather than focus on the technology of podcasts or audioblogging, I would like to see how a specific podcast functions and demonstrates the way forward. The author does mention one work, ""99% Invisible"", but it is given as an example of the form rather than being the focus of the field guide. 
 
 This follows in the ""Future Factor"" portion of the response. Rather than focus on how the podcast points the way to the future of books, the author instead digresses on an unrelated tangent. While it's certainly interesting information, thoughts on book distribution, government censorship, etc. don't seem to have a place in this particular assignment. 
 
 I believe the primary changes that need to be made are in organization. Focus on a single work, demonstrate how the form is superior (or at least the way forward) and finally why this constitutes the future of the book."
"I may be wrong in this assessment, but I believe that the ""description"" aspect of the assignment was to be less focused on the content of the novel and more on what makes the novel different from other novels. As the author notes, the content itself isn't unique in that sense. I would suggest refocusing the ""description"" on the process of the publication, rather than the content. That way, it would clear-up plenty of space in the ""Future Factor"" section to discuss how this process shows us a way forward in the future of the book."
"I'm not certain the author adequately explains the benefits of the ""lack of borders"". There is mention that ""the visual style of this story goes hand in hand with its format"" but not having read the work I'm not sure what this means, aesthetically. Likewise, ""it takes the act of reading a story and makes it almost into a film strip"" does not indicate why this is necessarily a positive development, or one that can be expanded to other works. 
 
 There is also some confusion that seems contradictory, such as ""some hosting sites have shrunk the pages down to a more ""normal"" size"", suggesting a traditional page layout, yet the author also says, ""it simply could not have been published in the old media"". A few lines clarifying this apparent contradiction would be helpful. 
 
 Overall, a focus on the effect of this borderless approach with this book, as well as ideas on how it could be beneficial in the future would be helpful."
"In this case, the author focuses on a technology, rather than a specific work. I believe that to properly fulfill the assignment, the guide should be refocused on a particular work that uses Tumblr as the medium, and use examples from that work to demonstrate how Tumblr is different from other mediums. While one author is mentioned as an example, the field guide would be stronger if it were focused on the work, rather than the technology."
"I have very few criticisms of this work. Perhaps it would be beneficial to distinguish between these sorts of websites and an ""ordinary"" website dedicated to a particular piece of fiction. For example, would the myriad of fan-made websites be considered a part of this expansion of the book, or would it be limited to author-run websites?"
"My only critiques are grammatical ones. In your summary you saidpeople can subscribe to as many different ones to follow and read each entry. You have a strong voice throughout your entry, however this sentence feels awkward and could be rearranged so I it feels more cohesive with the rest of the entry. 
 
 Then, in your description, when you saidto skydive out of a plain, plain should be plane. 
 
 Thats all I got :) great job!"
"My only critique is a grammatical one. In the description when you saidA animated and interactive telling of the books, a should be an. 
 
 Thats it :) great job!"
"Um...well...I really don't have much. What can I say, you did a great job. I guess you could give us a quick line describing what the story is about. I think that could make your description stronger."
"Your description was excellent, but I feel that your argument as to why this should be considered afuture book was lacking. To me it felt as if you were defending it against modern technology instead of embracing it as part of our future and where books are going. I think if you removed these sentences it might help alleviate that defensive stance:Scanimation books are impossible to recreate in digital format. If one was to do so, it would entirely devalue the retro novelty and simply exist as crude animation, like an animated gif.""
 
 
 
 Also, in your description, when you said11 Iconic Scenes from a Galax Far, Far Away¦ Galax should be Galaxy."
"I thought the field draft was well written, however in terms of the book's future factor I would like to know more about why other books would follow suit. It is clearly stated what makes the book different now, but what makes it special enough to be the future for other books?"
I feel the student's entry for future factor could do without the first three sentences. The student could easily use more examples of how the podcast is increasingly popular and what advances it is already making as well as why it will be more popular later.
"When reading the future factor I would like to know more about why this type of format is a natural progression. Would certain people not find it tedious? It is true that it may be a richer experience for those who are willing to try, but in all honesty how many people are willing to work and read? We live in an age where easy access and fun at your fingertips is most popular. So what makes this book accessible and how will other books follow?"
"Perhaps the student could explain why it would be a good idea for Emily C. to have her work only accessible online. The student has done a great job explaining why it was savvy for Emil C. to use her online resources, but why not also publish in print? What about people who are still reading physical books and struggle with the digital age? How will authors like Emily C. ease the people drifting behind into the future of e-books and online videos?"
"But will the blog replace the book? I see them co-existing as they do presently, but unless blogs progress in some way, I am not seeing the ""future book"" part."
"Future Factor was strong, but it did not match Summary and Description. Future Factor section had a great idea for future book format and good points about how fast technology is moving."
"Not sure how this is the future if it is now...? Also, can it be read on a phone or is size sometimes still a consideration for this format?"
"The persepective in section 2 confused me a little bit. It was almost more like a sales pitch or business case from the IDEO company than a field guide entry. I think the field guide entry should contain observations from an outside observer. I would remove the sense that the author has some sort of insight into the IDEO company motives for creating the programs and provide a more in-depth description of how the interface between the programs works.
 
 
 
 Section 3 could also use more objectivity. It reads like one who is partial to this particular program."
This entry highlights a very recent innovation. The case for this being futuristic is easy to make. I don't think it is a stretch to anticipate an increase in supporting content for novels. I agree that we will very likely see more of this type of interactive website in the future.
"My only criticism of this is that I would like the focus to be aimed more closely at the actual books hosted on Pottermore. The focus of the assignment should be specifically what constitutes the future of the book. The format of the books on Pottermore may be the way of the future. Maybe someday all books will be hosted on a centralized website, like libraries of the future, with interactive material being an expected requirement."
"I loved this entry. It is hard to come up with comments here; however, if I was to try to make an argument for the future factor of audio books I would cite the increase in handheld smart phone devices, blue tooth car interfaces, and other technological advancements which make audio books easier to consume.
 
 
 
 I would be very surprised if there wasn't readily available data regarding a correlation between increase in tablets and audio book popularity."
"This entry could focus a little bit more on the history of the book, and how e-readers fall into the development of the book. Furthermore, the author could touch on the ways in which people interact with e-readers today."
"The description section could be a little bit longer. After reading it, I was still wanted to know more. I would also discuss the history of children's book, and how they have progressed briefly that way there is a comparison with the future."
"This entry could delve into the history of the book, and how this is represents the future of the book. The assignment called for what happens in 1000 to 5000 years, so perhaps a more complete picture of what makes this ""futuristic"" is necessary."
"The summary of the book could be a little more specific. What formats are you talking about? The description section, while it is well-written, seems out of place for this assignment. The only futuristic thing about this book seems to be the plot line, until it is explained that it is a crowdsourced book. The author could speak a lot more to the futuristic elements of that, as oppose to a summary of the book."
"This entry could do more to find the futuristic nature of the book. Specifically, the line, ""This additional element of art makes the book futuristic as well,"" doesn't really make sense because art has been incorporated in books for thousands of years. What/how will we be living that makes this book so applicable to the future?"
"There are some minor editing errors that should be seen on a slow re-reading of the entry. Additionally, I was a little bit confused on the concept of scanimation. The author of the entry gives a comparison but I find myself still struggling to see the futuristic qualities of the book. The book sounds like it fits the bill to a futuristic book but also just sounds like a picture a book. Perhaps a little more explanation of scanimation would explain the book better."
"This entry does really great at explaining hybrid books and how they are a potential future book type. However, this wasn't the assignment. There isn't a clearly chosen book that is being described just an idea of a book type/genre."
This entry falls a bit short in the summary section. I think it might be the grammar in the first sentence that throws me a bit off as to what the actual product is. This is better described in the second section and there is a moment where the concept is clarified in my mind as a reader.
"I think a way to really improve this would be to include videos in this entry. This field guide is an online field guide, so it only makes sense to provide links to videos that would help show how documentaries will be the future of the book. 
 
 
 
 ""Take for example"" in the summary doesn't fit with the rest of the assignment, it is self-explanatory. Also, choose what you want your focus to be on- do you want it on ""Babies"" or on documentaries as a whole? If you choose to focus more on ""Babies"", then include it in your conclusion of how this is a future book. If you choose to focus on documentaries on a whole, then I would omit the reference to ""Babies"" and include clips from different documentaries to prove your point."
"Because the programs are very unique and many readers could be unfamiliar with their concepts I feel that the first two programs, Nelson and Coupland could have benefitted from an expanded description. I understand that the limited word space requires succinct phrasing, and the current descriptions do a fine job of describing the programs actual functions, but specific examples of something a reader could do while using the app (instead of just describing general functions) and how it would benefit the reader might have clarified the apps purpose and place in the future of the book, making the description a bit easier to understand, especially to those who are unfamiliar with the programs."
"While I like the ideas and direction of the ""future book"" entry, I think it would benefit from a slightly stronger focus on how this can shape the direction of books and readership. The author mentions that this idea could be applied to other books and other genres, it would be worth it to consider how one could do so, how could authors make the interaction for books uniquely individual like Rowling did, and what will that do for reading - will being able to participate in such and interactive and immersive world drastically change how people read? There are several interesting and unique applications this type of site has to books in the future and I think the analysis of the future section could benefit from some slightly deeper analysis to truly convince readers how this could change reading forever."
"The weakness of your paper is that you started off strong regarding Emily C. however finished somewhat generic with discussing an entire realm of futuristic literature. I am conflicted here because I do feel that the information you stated was important (one of the strengths I listed above) yet, I think you should find a more solid connection with Emilys journey. You mentioned that she was not associated with a publishing company, did she attempt to be published? Was publication a more difficult choice to spreading her story than e-book? I believe the convenience of publication online could be discussed, wherein that is also important to why she most likely decided to go this route, publishing a book is a confusing and long journey, yet the instantpublishing online does the job; thus the reason for so many disappearing bookstores."
"It matches. Once the program starts to run, the walker starts to walk towards the bottom-left corner, kinda staggered. But it's not clear if the robot, after reaching the bottom-left corner, stops at that particular position or just moves out side of the window."
"Umm, how does that describe the behavior of the walker object? This isn't supposed to be an artists statement but a description of the behavior of your walker object by using some behavior that is found in the natural world or described through a character of some kind. The Sporadic adjective does kinda work since the movement seems random, but I would really try to make your object link to something in life besides a square."
"Simple and straight to the point, this patch was fun and easy to use. The primary sound was simple but slightly annoying (perhaps like a good 'no' sound should be. The surprise of the 'yay' when I found the yes key was extremely pleasing and the the fireworks certainly added a cool surprise."
"The patch is very simple to use, but overall not very user friendly. For example, in order for the patch to work the user must load the clips and then turn on the sound. Adding some comments would help the user know what to do. PS! Thanks for not using the most annoying failure sound!! A lot of other patches use really annoying failure sounds and, since you end up hearing it over and over it gets really annoying. So thanks for using something that's not horrible!"
"The patch feels simple and clean, seemingly trying to be easily understood rather than technically efficient."
I found the coding to be basically the same as shown in class. The two extra switches I thought maybe could have been removed. The sound was original as well.
"The patch was pretty standard in terms of technical setup. It followed the tutorial correctly. As mentioned above, the maniacal laugh was pretty surprising. I cant imagine what people with headphones might have done. The sounds chosen did get a bit annoying after multiple key presses, so using multiple laugh tracks might help with the monotony that tends to occur after multiple attempts. In the future I might suggest labeling your files with your name or some kind of identifier - especially if an instructor is going to be looking at it."
"I like the simple layout and the description used to navigate the user into understanding the patch and what it does. They approached it the same way we approached it in class whereas one key is good, and the other key is bad. They could have made more good keys."
The patch was neat and organized. But a few of the pieces like the buttons didn't need to be there.
"There was some key hunting, and the 'no' sound, which was from Sonic, was a little grating to the ears after a while because of how loud it was being played. The 'yes' sound highly amused me, the victory sound from any given Final Fantasy game. It did feel like a victory after finally finding the 'good' key. It was a nice experience overall."
"Technically, it wasn't anything complicated, and nothing experimental about it. Because of how simple it was, I didn't learn anything new and nothing jumped out at me. Which is fine since the path to each part was laid out to where it should be. Maybe adding a level meter in just to give the user an idea of how loud everything is, and possibly making sure before using a sound that it's not too loud for the user. Other than that, it was a pretty good patch."
it was pretty simple only thing i would have done differently would be shortening the victory sound file
They didn't do anything exciting or surprising but they made the patch as simplistic as possible and I almost think that's better than any extra elements. It makes it so the patch is very easy to read and the user can understand everything that's taking place.
"I had trouble figuring out what I was supposed to do. The directions were a little too cryptic for me, and while I might just be too new at Max, I feel like the average beginner might have been as confused as I was. The sounds were kind of hard to understand as well. I could barely tell what either of them were saying - if it hadn't been for the note, I don't think I would have made out the ""amen"" correct key sound."
"I learned how to select multiple keys/values using the select object, which was something I was trying to do when creating my patch, and for some reason I just couldn't get it to work. Despite my confusion, I think this person did a pretty good job on the assignment. They achieved something completely unique to what I have seen so far. My one suggestion would be to find clearer and possibly shorter sounds."
"The functionality is simple to use, which is great. There was a voice recording of the word hallelujah and a voice recording of word your wrong. Even when I had my volume on high they were still hard to hear, and the word, ""your wrong"" was very hard to make out. I think the simplicity of the words chosen is good because it is obvious as it relates to this project. I feel the user experience would be straight forward in terms of the literal, ""good key/bad key"" assignment."
"It is small and compressed, which I like, but the opening window was very large. It it clean and well placed, easy on the eyes. However, there are no comments, which would make it difficult to follow."
"I think you did a good jobs, and also picked a really impressive music, however I think that you might be able to try something more advance or more creative."
"It was approached in a different way than what the lecture taught, which is always welcome. What the creator could do is to explain the features of the patch so new users don't get lost on it."
"It looks like there is no actual selection operator for the good key or bad key. There are comments however but they didn't seem to relate to the content of the patch. My question is: were they trying to use the MATCH object, but didn't use it successfully?"
"Did not work. There was no operator to select a good or bad key. The wav files were pleasant to listen to, a soft ""hello"" and ""goodbye"" with a very nice voice. It made me want to use the patch but I could only press the open operator to make the patch play a sound."
The patch looks well organized though I am not entirely sure the purpose of the boxes that say what is.. and awkward. It is easy to understand the flow of the code.
"It was fairly straight forward so I did not learn anything new in the coding. I think to do this better the author could have added the select message to operate the program to make sound. I think the clarity was well accomplished, and in the future they can focus on being more technically intense."
The patch looks nice but with a few extraneous pieces. Unfortunately there is a note telling me exactly which key is the right one so I didn't have to look for it. It kind of defeats the purpose of this patch.
"The student added in an extra tool for showing the audio level, yet besides that, there is nothing surprising or exciting. It seems that they tried to add more to it, even with the little we have learned in class. It's hard to say what could have been done better."
"I really like how things are laid out in this patch, it is pleasant to look at. They did show the winning key however, which doesn't make the game much 'fun'. There are some added functions like the meters which give the patch more personality."
"Aside from the sounds and extra meter, I'd say this patch was pretty run of the mill. I didn't really see a use for the extra meter, but it did add a little extra visual component to the project. One thing I think could be improved is that there was a little extra length of ""noise"" at the end of the yes soundbite and that probably could have been trimmed off."
"They seemed to have decided to just stack the codes on top of each other which worked. I think comments would have made for a better experience, so I could test the patch quickly without having to google the right code. I would have added the comment boxes for faster testing."
"Seriously kind of aggrivated. I understand why the coding was so squished now, because the key to activate it was control and the v key. And no, I did not figure it out on my own, I looked it up because I was so annoyed I kept hearing high ho silver awaaaay. When I finally heard the correct sound I was a bit confused, but I guess it makes sense it was talking about teeth and having silver plates on them or else it could cause gingivitis? I don't know, didn't understand that joke.."
"I would have liked more notes and the whole thing just seemed a little crammed together. There's space! Use it! There's also a number box with a -127, and I'm not sure why."
"I only got one of the sounds to trigger - the ""no."" The Ace Ventura sounds were cool and all, but only if it actually works."
"The patch looks very good, and is condensed a lot. But still looks like it took some technical abilities to make."
"Firstly, the sounds are fantastic. The creator expertly utilizes the concept of ""cuteness"". Even though the patch is very simple, the fact that it makes ""human"" sounds gives it an air of humanity."
"The patch is very simple, but the creator could have added a few things to make it easier to the user. Firstly, comments that tell the user to turn on the sound, for example, would make is user friendly. Secondly, adding a few features like the ability to pick the ""success"" key would be a great feature for this patch."
Simple and not as developed as it could have been. On a positive note it was not intimidating.
"Basic concept, kind of monotonous and it took me while to find the 'yes' key! The redeeming factor was the 'yes' sound was crazy and strange and interesting which made it worth the wait."
"There was a really cool and neat idea in the patch that somehow along the way didn't come through. I don't know if something had a wrong path, or something. I did see two message boxes before the speaker, so I don't know if that was the problem or not. The idea was exiting, but sadly I couldn't hear it."
"So far this patch is the smallest I've seen. Everything is very condensed which almost makes it look clustered but also gives the patch a sense of unity. It's very clear everything works together and makes the patch seem like a whole thing rather than a bunch of parts working together. This aesthetic is very interesting, I haven't seen it before."
This patch looked a little to clumped together. I think it would look more clear and professional if there was more space in between each of the keys. I also don't see the a button that explains the letter that represents the good key so I'm unsure which key to hit.
"This patcher followed all the right rules and components of this assignment. I still suggest spacing out the buttons/keys to look better and cleaner. In this case, I would also advise on stating which key is the good key for the sake of time for this critique assignment. But it still played the sounds and functioned perfectly."
The sounds are entertaining. It's a bit confusing that the sound is used for both good key and bad key. At first it made me think I had pressed both keys or there was an error in the way it was coded. I then realized the same sound is used within the good key sound as the bad key sound. It's very easy to use and navigate.
"Like I said before, it was done very simply. Which is always good. The simpler the better. However, I kinda would have liked to see comments of some sort. If I had no idea what was going on, I would be incredibly lost. Honestly, I didn't really learn anything new from this patch."
Before I ran the patch the overall look and feel was very confusing to me at first. I was unsure how it worked together. I have limited experience with Max and this may be my reason for my confusion but I do think it could be a little more cleaned up.
"I appreciate the fact that Tom tried to do something different with his project and expand upon what was taught in class, but I do think he could have organized it better and chosen sounds that aren't extremely similar to each other. There is just a lot going on in this patch and I think it should have been simplified."
